[00:00:05.16],Liz,"Okay so, I don't have to use the chat, I am just gonna use the human chat, right?"
[00:00:12.24],Maggie,"Yeah, the old fashion way "
[00:00:14.27],Liz,"Unofficially I am going to talk to you, well okay. This is lovely, I am ready"
[00:00:21.24],Maggie,"Excellent. Yeah so, just to kind of, ah the eagles eyes view, or where it will land a little bit, ah what kind of brought us to this point was, we've been looking more closely to into the new terrain project and the terrain side of things. And a big part of that is ah and or really I, within that reviewing the evaluation documents that Theresa sent us about new gen thing and we were specifically reviewing the survey responses from participants about their hub groups, which we thought were interesting and somewhat all over the place and so we were curious to see a little bit from your perspective about your experience with them, or your impression, your takeaways from the. And with that more specific or specific interview questions. Jean is there anything I am missing that you wanna add one? [Jean is on mute] Oh, I cant hear you."
[00:01:32.17],Liz,Sorry I couldn't hear Jean either
[00:01:36.21],Maggie,Oh we still can't hear you
[00:01:40.27],Jean,"I muted myself because I was gonna be on the keyboard and you would have to hear the keys go clack clack clack. This was been an evolution in our thinking, Liz "
[00:01:57.03],Liz,"I am very interested, tell me more"
[00:01:59.17],Jean,"Well, just two things, we had that really really good talk with you and we have tried to knit together, what Teresa did. with respect to the survey work and other material that she send in to the department of ed. And then I- it dawned on me one day that a person we cannot leave out of this conversation is Sydney Kern. Because then she, when the program, the project was finished, she started project sing as you know. Which is a clear example of someone taking, a component of new terrain and um, I am blanking out, the next iteration. [Maggie: the projects] the (sand) and moving that, into a teacher education setting, and so that provided us we've had, you know, I think at least two of you have done more Maggie. Two calls? Two calls with her possible a third coming up, and what we discovered is she did some survey work herself so we have been looking to unpack that a little bit but it's clear that program had some elements of success to it and we were able to I think, we're gonna be able to sort leave all of that together, because it's great not only to see a model program being and active but also replicated in a way that needs particular audience "
[00:04:04.24],Liz,absolutely 
[00:04:06.01],Jean,"Then in that conversation with Cindy, again it dawned on me that we had these hub groups and they didn't really get the gravitas, the traction we may wanted to have but they were there, and they were a part of the new terrain, and so we wanted to circle back with you today and your thoughts on, Maggie had a lot of questions, I'll put myself on mute but that's kind of where we had been, since we talked with you and it's neat to see all the puzzle pieces kind of coming together "
[00:04:55.12],Liz,"Right, you know really good use of the term evolution Jean, because you talking over a period of time, when did we start, in 2013 I think?"
[00:05:07.03],Jean, We started 2013/2014
[00:05:17.16],Liz,"So you know you're looking over a period 6 years, a while and NGSX was evolving, NGSS was evolving, we haven't been dealing with stationary parts at all. You know for describing the project, you just have to keep that in the foreground sort of how much fluctuation there was in outcome, inputs were also fluctuating. "
[00:05:55.01],Jean," Well that's true, that is absolutely true but what I think each iteration there was greater definition [Liz: Huge] in the beginning to occur, and you know, we've got a think about that that's an important part of the evolution to capture "
[00:06:16.29],Liz,"Right, what we thought we needed at the beginning evolved over time, we didn't know what we needed, we knew what some of our constrains were, challenges were, definitely I would say our goals shifted, as the needs became more clear to us and I think probably need to continue to have, so that's a great opener in terms of the conversation about what I was thinking about hubs back in 2013, and what worked and what didn't work because of it, that might be the subject of a whole another paper is the evolution of the process, certainly we were building the airplane as we were flying it and adjusting and changing as we saw outcomes, so let's circle back in time to where we were in 2013"
[00:07:27.06],Jean,Maggie you take it over and I'll go back on mute 
[00:07:31.06],Maggie,Sounds good
[00:07:33.17],Liz,"Right, I just pressed on one. That's right what was your vision to the purpose of this subgroups?"
[00:07:40.23],Maggie,"Exactly, yeah "
[00:07:42.03],Liz,"Alright that was a opener, so I am going back now and in my mind you know as the state's science leader back then. What shaped my context was also development and adoption of the common core and I am not gonna try to not to do a lot of side bar walk but I am like context is everything it's very interesting. So just in brief, the release of common core standards happen in a very compressed way, well fairly in a very different way than NGSX, quite deliberately so, I happen to be the state lead apartment or common core adaption, so I was heavily involved in um, planning, there wasn't much planning for it because it was a given that every state was going to adapt you had to if you wanted to race to the top grant so the political context at the time was you're gonna take this standards and you're gonna join a testing (consursion) and maybe you will get a lot of money but it was certainly forced into the states policy, when at that time in my experience as the state leader, I was quite aware that our teacher preparation program were operating as very independent entities, Connecticut is a type of state, where everybody school districts, everybody likes there own space and nobody likes a state to tell them what to do-"
[00:10:03.04],Maggie,So just a-
[00:10:03.04],Liz,And I don't know- say that again
[00:10:05.23],Maggie,"Just a quick question, so independent you mean with a, that more state centered approach "
[00:10:15.00],Liz,"Strong centralized system, in some states where there is a, there a state, there is a state school, you know I can say this for sure, more similarities in the curriculum in the curriculum or in the programming, but in our systems there are certain standards that they need to meet but they need to meet them in many different ways. But you know in short, the important part, point that I wanted to make, the teacher prep programs very independent of each other and the faculty responsible for teaching science education course didn't know each other so in relatively small state let's say, I can't remember the exact number, we have 12 teacher step program, say there were 14 faculty members who all teach some sort of science teacher preparation course. there was no infrastructure to bring them together, no association, no meetings, no commonalities no communication, not only did they never collaborate before, they didn't even know each other as individuals, you know here I am back in time and I am watching this very sporadic bumpy adoption of common core standards which in some ways were very different than previous standards and in some ways not so different, it was a very you know, it was a process full of step and missteps and halts and starting again and I thought I have to do something differently going to achieve change on a large scale level, and so I would say, I would have to characterize changes that, I saw in science education in Connecticut in the 15 years that I was in the state education department very sporadic and spotty, little pockets, a isolated pockets here, this district was very forward thinking this district had a superintendent that valued science but small scale and nothing systemic, just little pockets of change that are happening here or there, you know its almost serendipitous, it's almost not measurable to stand up and say see how much better we're doing, so the first thing that in my mind was, gosh wouldn't it be great if there was a way for all of these teacher prep faculty to come together and share ideas and in some ways forge some commonalities across the board something that would feel more systemic at least among the teacher preparation, right it's a whole different challenge to be in service teachers even more challenging because they are spread out across in Connecticut you know in 169 towns, but I thought we could accomplish a lot of good things. So among the things I wanted to accomplish through hubs was first and foremost to bring together university faculty so they could get to know each other, might lead to increased collaboration so would illuminate around what next generation science teaching and learning. They were not all people actively involved in the development of next generation science, none of them were involved in the development. So without the hub coming together around NGSX I think there would have been, very little awareness and opportunity to upgrade their own thinking, so hubs were a meant to be a respectful of saying come take a look at this and see if you might think this might be a significant change and not same old same old we've been there done that, so those were two initial goals raising there awareness planting the seeds for them to change their own thinking about what is science teaching and learning look like in the next generation and inducing greater levels of collaboration among them, in a respectful setting without saying, here's the state coming in to tell you what you don't know"
[00:16:02.14],Maggie,"Right, that's that's-"
[00:16:05.04],Liz,Umm
[00:16:05.28],Maggie,"Yeah and do you feel that, that was able to come to fruition? Especially given that the hub groups turned out not to just be focused on higher education faculty and teacher preparation programs and faculty, yeah"
[00:16:28.17],Liz,"If keeping in mind that those were my two primary goals were designing hubs, I remember drawing out the diagram, cause I have people that are, you know distances away and they are busy people, this was not their highest priority at the time. You know dealing with the college faculty mindset which is, you know I took a look at this, I get it, I know what it means. So the hub our way to deal with the, the specifically distance separating them, so we're gonna try and make it convenient and easy for you to meet. NGSX was the critical anchor to that, cause they would be meeting in different locations and at different times that was more convenient for them but they were all working with the same material so there was a unifying factor, which continues to be which I think is one of the very best parts about NGSX as a professional learning system, you know it's unifying and so I think it was number 1 successful as the faculty got to know each other and they actually got to like each other and they got to trust each other and it led to continued collaboration, maybe not within every single one of them but the evidence of Cindy Kerns came off you know even though I am retired for three years now, you know I follow what's going on in the states, I can see that 2/3 of the faculty that were in new terrain everything with the Connecticut science teaching association during this professional development. That makes my heart think cause I used to think that never used to happen before and I feel as if it's attribute to the hubs "
[00:18:37.19],Maggie,Very cool
[00:18:38.12],Liz," And the ongoing relationships is it better than it was? Yes I think it is much better in term of collaboration and more consistency from higher ed to higher ed institution definitely more consistency, none was before. They all designed their own courses as long as they were following the NFDA standards teacher prep, which was written eons ago and I think are very outdated and I don't know if they have been updated. NGSX became a vehicle, not the perfect vehicle in that will lead I am sure to what comes out in surveys and what I know where the, not successes of it. But those two things getting them together, getting them to know each other and using them to work together in an ongoing basis, getting more consistency from across the different institution. I think that vision was realized that extenuate I have no way of knowing what's in there curriculum now, what they need but I do know from the, the grant projects that followed after new terrain that each of them at least in some way made an effort to incorporate next gen science teacher and learning aspects into their courses, at least I know that they were making that up. Which was something they just invented, you know it came from the work that we did in new terrain. "
[00:20:36.26],Maggie,"Right, and do you feel like, I guess just generally from anecdotal evidence do you feel like those changes and successes among the faculty in the hubs made it, or did it sort of trickle down into the successful implementation of NGSS or for the teachers as well. "
[00:21:02.20],Liz,"Yes, that's what's, I don't have the measures of that. That's where we always, I think it's just in the world of measurement, a project like this. It's really hard, but you can always collect data about what the project did, we did this, some did workshops, and we did this. You can always collect data about the input, getting the output in terms of change in teaching and then ultimately change in student thinking, those are the harder ones and most of the project don't attempt to do that, the projects that I funded with our MSP grant I really tried to push hard for some- get classroom evidence, get some baseline evidence, and we did try and do that with the faculty's curriculum, I remember in the beginning of new terrain we asked to, give their syllabus, what they were currently teaching and then do it again at the end of the 3-year project and look for change and I think we had at least change in what they were teaching. I know what isn't enough, at least I know that isn't enough for me , it's like okay what's happening in the k-12 classrooms, what's changing? How was it before? And how has it changed, I don't have good evidence of that, in one of the other MSD projects we had a video tape, we had somebody actually go out and video tape the classrooms. I wish I could say it's made a difference I don't know that"
[00:22:57.02],Maggie,"No yeah, absolutely "
[00:22:59.08],Liz,"As I am reflecting on you know. on the answer to my question about what my goal were for the hubs, I am noticing that most of it was not about NGSS or about NGSX most of it was about can we call get together, think collectively about what this means? Can we work together? Can we change it so that we have better consistency and about what was almost secondary but I will- it couldn't have happened without NGSX without a tool"
[00:23:40.14],Jean,"I was gonna say, is I think common experience that both teachers and faculty and teachers had together, was certainly stronger in some parts of the state than others and-"
[00:23:59.03],Liz,Oh gosh I am sure
[00:24:01.20],Jean,"There are examples for it, um at UConn, a paper was published Todd, TJ was a part of that which really looked at the hub and looked at what came out of it and I would say that UConn is one example and its interesting because it has a footprint in the state- "
[00:24:32.08],Liz,"Yeah but not in terms of number, not in terms of number of teachers that they produce, it's a big university but there one of the biggest teacher pr-"
[00:24:44.21],Jean,"-producers of it, yeah you're right "
[00:24:45.08],Liz,"But yeah go on, finish your thought "
[00:24:53.19],Jean,"All I wanna say is that, there are a number of ways in which, that faculty did come together although you know that was fits and starts, TJ served as a good magnet to try to get that faculty cohering um, and as you say it, it's a difficult position no matter where higher ed is just that way but I think that's an example and I don't know if you have seen Todd's paper "
[00:25:35.26],Liz,"I may or may not please just send it to me, I would be, I would be very interested "
[00:25:40.22],Jean,"I'll make a note to myself, to send you that paper and it was published"
[00:25:46.27],Liz,"Yeah well you know, points out what the biggest challenge and I hate to use the word failure but in my find that didn't look what we didn't accomplish, that we thought we would that we thought everybody in a room with NGSX, as it was at the time remember, a lot of changes because of what we learned first hub session that we saw that NGSX could serve as the moderator and what I saw when I saw the hubs and I remember we paid Bonnie, we paid Bonnie to go and sit in on hub groups and do some day to day how they were functioning and what they were learning, I listened very closely anecdotally, well they were all over the place because without a moderation to stir the pot and catalyze the learning, they didn't get nearly as much as out of the NGSX as I would have hoped. There was-"
[00:27:10.18],Jean, I think both catalyzing institutionalizing the learning 
[00:27:18.01],Liz,"So there was great variation from hub to hub, about what their takeaway from each of the hub session where they did an NGSX component, you know our first model was let's take turns and you be the moderator this week and you be the moderator the next time we get together and we thought that was kinda like full proof, the biggest takeaway for me and for you and Ryan was, oh woah that was, it's really important to have a highly trained moderator to mediate the learning "
[00:27:56.24],Jean,"And you're right, we have to make a note of this Maggie that we wanna spend some time, we used to think this could be up here driven, "
[00:28:07.14],Liz,"Yes that's were we started out, right."
[00:28:12.03],Jean,"That you need a highly skilled facilitator at the center and um, that's come home to us since spades with the last four or five years, no question about that"
[00:28:28.26],Liz,"Yeah that was the latest discovery, I think it changed our thinking and we tried to adjust for it in mid stream, but never the next set of the second of the new terrain was, okay we finished NGSX, so we need to start and apply that in our own classroom, try and design some story line, um so you know we did that not just because it was in Bryan's interest working on in his work but we needed to start to bring them back together and fill in the gaps that had been left initial experience of NGSX clearly by the second year, when we first started to talk about coherence, sequencing unpacking concepts things like that you could see that there were gaps, there were things that they didn't get from NGSX about, making thinking public about critical discussions, there were a lot of gaps and I think what we tried to do to adjust sort of so that in as needed, as they were applying it to working on units. So for me that was the biggest take away, they were convenient, they got people to come, you have to remember this was a time when people were not banging down the door to sign up for three years of coursework and you know 30 hours of professional learning, it was hard for me to instill those kinds of offerings so, I had to be, you know as diplomatic as possible about saying how can we get people to come, you know like on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it's like well they are not gonna get takeaways if they are not there, let's first get me there. It's sounds so funny but so it was big challenge "
[00:30:55.19],Jean,"On the other hand when that second unit moved into instructional units, that was something that I think that groups grew into and advanced because they could see the utility of it [Liz: yes] for your courses"
[00:31:18.03],Jean,"That's when it, you know what, I think their learning really kicked in the second and third year, we all realize that, you know, because we learned it, when we first started we thought it was just a plug and play um, so I think it's all good teaching in classrooms, teach a lesson and you think it's gonna go great and it doesn't and you think and well boy when I come back tomorrow here's what I am gonna do come at this differently and that's what we did, might not have been ideal but it helped NGSX to grow and I think it influenced, the newer units that you were putting together, and it certainly helped solidify and bring together the groups, I thought the, I know you are interested in the hubs. Did we still call them hubs in year 2 and 3, we transitioned into unit groups, so you weren't necessarily working with your same hub, I think, do you remember Jean?"
[00:32:25.25],Jean,"That is correct, we didn't call them hubs and in fact the groups, sort of reconstituted themselves around- "
[00:32:37.25],Liz,"I think around what- right (unclear) right, and wasn't much a reason"
[00:32:48.08],Jean,"Two of those curriculum units are some of our popular units, not that they haven't undergone some improvement and strengthening so and so forth but roadkill which is now "
[00:33:09.00],Liz," the corn, harvest corn "
[00:33:09.29],Jean,"And harvest corn, are still present tools in Connecticut"
[00:33:19.15],Liz,And beyond because
[00:33:21.02],Jean,Oh and beyond
[00:33:23.00],Liz,"Well at least, I don't know if road kill has gotten NGSX gold seal of approval but I think"
[00:33:31.02],Jean,It's not call roadkill anymore
[00:33:37.24],Liz,"Right, and harvest corn has, that's something worth you know reflecting on so as an outcome, you know from this original group which again was a pioneering group early on that two units have gone on, the NGSX seal of approval as high quality next generation units. How many people get to work directly with you know Bryan Riser and Mark Novak on developed curriculum, I mean Jesus, quite the opportunity to sit in side by by side and work on it together "
[00:34:19.10],Jean,"Well even Michael and Bryan were feeling the way on this, I think that-"
[00:34:24.29],Liz,And they learned a lot too
[00:34:27.01],Jean,They learned a tremendous lot and both of them have gone on now and they are focusing only on curriculum but I think those two summers spent on curriculum were very definitive for the project
[00:34:53.08],Liz,"Right, it was closer to each teacher's work you know it's this is something I am gonna teach and the other wonderful thing from years 2 and 3 when although they weren't called hubs they were still inward groups that were drawing from multiple school districts, was the opportunity to work on curriculum with college faculty typically I am the knower and giver of wisdom and I give to you but here their role changed being peer and they were shoulder to shoulder as experiences classroom teachers have a great advantage, they had never written a NGSX type learning unit either so I thought that gives me great pride, I loved to watch them working together and learning together because it was a different dynamic that type of relationship and so, I felt fortunate to have those kinds of people who were willing to put egos aside for the most part and they, you know what this is really hard to write these units and give each other feedback and to listen to each other, that was very gratifying."
[00:36:23.01],Maggie,"Absolutely, speaking a little bit about the ego question, I would love to circle back a little bit to talk about the hub group mentors, I know that's a little bit going into different direction, so are there any, any last comment before we shift in that direction?"
[00:36:43.07],Liz,So back you year one hub group mentors
[00:36:47.28],Maggie," Year 1 and year 2, both either neither "
[00:36:53.06],Liz,"Okay, the year 1 hub leadership was very lack because it was you know driven from within so they each took a turn stepping up to the plate, some of the, without the mediation of the learning, discussions that are so important part of NGSX might take place very brief all answers are equally acceptable because we're all polite and we're being nice to each other and teacher believe that when you are in your classroom you accept all right answers and you say very good Sally, very good Jose, that's very interesting so there's no critical thinking or elevating of ideas things like that would get perpetuated, you can't call a molecule an air puppy because that's just plain wrong, would get perpetuated rather than having somebody to lead the conservation does it really matter what the name is? Or is it important we understand that this is very tiny piece of something and it behaves in a certain way that's very predictable, so teachers get hinge up on the right word and miss the bigger idea and I think that happens in hub groups, there was nobody to push back, I remember having a conservation on the phone with Bryan about it, I sat in on one of this session in a way biting my lip and thinking, uh I don't think that's supposed to happen, I had a conversation with Bryan and I said what are you thoughts and we went like a little ballistic, absolutely not! All answers are not equal, well but so, there was insufficient leadership of the hubs there was very democratic equal sometimes the faculty member just because of their status as faculty might take more of a leader role but at that stage, remember this is you know early 2013, they didn't know anything about NGSX and science than the people sitting around them they had no, no good of knowing any more about it so, the leadership in those groups were lacking, sometimes I think the attendance was sporadic, um I wouldn't be at all surprised or offended if the survey said, I thought the hub groups were a waste of time, you know we finished up early and we went home. And I think in many hub groups, possibly because of the faculty member. there was sometimes a lack of energy and that probably lessened the amount of change from it, I think there was a lack of leadership in general."
[00:40:30.17],Maggie,But then again-
[00:40:31.06],Liz,"Back to the original goal, you know let's get hubs so we can at least start getting people together around some common learning materials, it went, they showed up, they did the best they could given what they knew at the time, um they establish relationships you know teacher to teacher and teacher to faculty members, I think those were the high points, "
[00:41:00.21],Maggie,"Right and I think it's interesting to, I am curious to hear your thoughts on this, cause there were some survey responses that I saw, along the lines that the hubs were not everything I hoped they would be and a little more on the negative coherence side but there were also folks that had really positive experiences in their hub group is your impression that the more positive experiences are also a product of a leadership among the faculty members, similarly to how you were saying that it might be negative, the negative experiences might be a result of less energy or more negative energy from a leadership role"
[00:41:48.09],Liz,"Yeah, I mean as the state leader and I was, you know I was very dedicated to the cause and science education and so if I see a bad hub, I think oh god I gotta fix it somehow, that's not to say because I focused on fixing the problem, that's not to say that nothing good came of them but I was fully aware that there was a lot of diversity, a lot of variation in what the output were from hub to hub and it's the difference in personality, never, I didn't appoint the faculty member to be the leader I didn't think it would be fair to them, I invited them to be learners, alongside the people who thought in their region, so it was kind of a different kind of role, you know I didn't expect them step up to the plate and lead it think some of them when they perceived that the need for some leadership to stir the pot some, I think some of them just stepped up naturally because that's what they do. But yeah it wouldn't surprise me if people said, I didn't get much out of it cause I think that's true. So it's good that, if they all great reviews well then I am not learning enough, you know tell what was not so good and then I can learn from that, so I am glad that they were honest."
[00:43:34.02],Maggie,"Yeah that was definitely my impression that the variety of responses I think, to me signaled a little bit of honesty, and yeah I think. Just to clarify for my own sake, the problems or the challenges that we were talking about were they expand both years of the hub groups or were they more the first year hub groups that and then you were talking about how you worked to resolve some of the, especially the challenges in facilitation and leadership in the second year hub groups or are you talking about both?"
[00:44:11.06],Liz,"Ah, much more so the first, the first year hubs were working on their own, the second were, I forget exactly what they were called learning unit groups? Teams? Something, you chose your team, so there was choice, they chose teams on something that were teaching, they were very positive about working with other teachers who were teaching the same group that they were teaching, and there was very strong leadership in year 2 and year 3, most of the work were down over the summer session and we had learning leaders there, we had Sarah and Bryan and Jean and Mike, I don't know if there was anybody else? So we were always circulating among the works of the work was much controllable than went it was out in their hubs doing their own thing and completely different feeling in terms of leadership and staying focused and getting great feedback and sharing with others, so that was a big improvement and lessoned learned"
[00:45:33.29],Maggie,"Absolutely, very cool. Yeah I feel like I have learned a lot, I feel like we covered most of our questions do you have anything to add or follow up? Or anything you want to say Liz that you didn't"
[00:45:51.15],Liz,"Yeah I am looking at question 4 and I would like to say a little bit more about question 4, do I feel like that there were an overall positive outcome for the goal of NGSX implementation? That's loaded, that's loaded working in there, at the undergraduate high school or elementary level were they? So, again, there's one thing to learn, to look closely at the process of professional learning, what were the inputs, what did we do, how did it work, to look at the outcome, the positive outcomes I think we talked a lot about, if one of the outcomes we are looking at it is NGSX implementation, I would say we have a way to go, yes we touched as many school districts as we could, in project but you're still talking about one or two teachers from each school and so that limits it spreads. In other words when it spreads from the people who were at the core of the workshop they probably get the strongest dose of the medicine and then when they go back to their own school and they are talking to the teacher who teaches chemistry next door to them, that chemistry teacher might get a, definitely gets a more loose dose, might pick up one or two things that might make a difference but there's no guarantee on that, so farther you get away from people who had the direct experience, more dilute the effect is. I think in Connecticut as well as nationally NGSX implementation is still a widely defined term, what does that mean? And NGSS impact on teaching and learning that's like a whole other thing, when people talk about NGSS implementation, they say, yup I am teaching those standards, yup I am teaching waves, I am teaching this and I threw out that old unit and I put in this one. Yeah I am implementing it and my kids took a test this year. And, mostly everything will stay the same, where do I think Connecticut is how do I think new terrain may or may not have effected it, well alright, given the fact that I am not in that role anymore and I am not talking with teachers all the time in school so, I would have to say I am definitely have a very distant helicopter view from talking to colleagues who are still in the states and my input from the people I talk to is that high school have paid very little attention to NGSS, so there is not a high school NGSS assignment and for the most part, my sense is that they are pretty much teaching science the way they always taught science, implementation in elementary school or you know K through 8. maybe maybe the greatest impacts are at the middle grades 6 to 8, those are the kids who get to have science everyday, not so at the elementary school NGSS didn't change that as much as you know as much as the framework, the writers and the position statements all say, you know kids need to learn science in elementary school, you can say it till the cows come home but that doesn't change the way the school say is shaped so I have very minimal expectation about what any dramatic change that will take place in the elementary level or have taken place, I think maybe, the most impact will be felt at the middle grades they come to science, we have NGSX available to them, we have, there many more sample learning units that are available nationally now than there were back in 2013, sometimes the learning material can serve as a form professional development, not the best but there's no other way to reach so many teachers I would say, looking at it from a far now, minimal impact on NGSX implementation, that sounds very sad doesn't it?"
[00:51:30.28],Maggie,Jean you're still muted
[00:51:33.12],Jean, [talks while muted] I wanna dispute that just a little bit
[00:51:45.06],Liz,Was that too gloomy?
[00:51:47.25],Jean,"Well I think it's a matter of understanding what we mean NGSX implementation. I think if we go back historically, look at new terrain and the purpose for new terrain and then a project assent, came into being. Which had a very very different purpose and one of the purposes of that and the connection to the Connecticut Science Center, beginning to scale up, at least teachers awareness of NGSS and what was intended by the practices, what was intended by the cross cutting ideas so, and I think-"
[00:52:39.07],Liz,But I think more for pre-service teachers right? 
[00:52:42.15],Jean,"Right, it wasn't focused on pre-service teaching"
[00:52:49.04],Liz,Oh I thought it was
[00:52:49.21],Jean,"Not project assent. It was focused on elementary and middle school teachers, some high school teachers who came, I mean it focused on getting a group of teachers coming from the same building or the same district, so that- you know there would be more knowledge based in a school or district, so what happened over time "
[00:53:24.01],Liz,So you can maybe hope for-
[00:53:22.09],Jean, hmm?
[00:53:26.28],Liz,Maybe you can hope for whole school change if everybody is rowing in the same boat
[00:53:32.28],Jean,"Right and I think, some of the remarkable changes that came into being, especially in the elementary grade was the confidence that the teachers gained in changing their pedagogy, in science education and not having the kids just definition or parrot back, a particular kind of definition or understanding, it was a opening up to a door to productive talk so a lot of epistemic knowledge building tools, introduced to NGSX and where we not we may not be direct teachers to the, to each verse of NGSS, what assent did was equipped with more complex pedagogical tools to take back and I think that has been very successful, the-"
[00:54:48.18],Liz,"Even though schools have teachers that were participating, what's your best guess?"
[00:54:56.22],Jean,"Um we have to track down, that how many districts that are in the state and how many representative we have from all over the districts, but there are districts that are interesting to talk about from you know kind of a case study perspective, Ellington is one. For all kinds of reason, it can be, you would think it would be a more successful district. But what happened in Ellington is that, for example Liz Cole, who stayed with project assent for a number of years was promoted in that district and every time she was promoted, she had a say in the kind of professional development that wanted to bring into that district, "
[00:56:01.28],Liz,Those are the kind of outcomes in all of the MSP projects that always make me feel good
[00:56:09.29],Jean,And that should
[00:56:09.29],Liz,"The little seed, that's right, you hope that the little seed will grow, they will spread and become invasive seeds, so that's a success"
[00:56:19.28],Jean,"It is a success and the other successful piece at that was, we had funding to develop the pathway for administrators"
[00:56:33.16],Liz,Absolutely
[00:56:35.14],Jean,"And when we had that good working combination with the administrators coming to their day and half experience and finally understanding what all of this is about, NGSS business. They became much more supportive of their teachers and they became more knowledgeable when they made classroom observations, so I think--"
[00:57:02.27],Liz,Those are excellent
[00:57:06.14],Jean,"- that I have to think a little bit about, but I think there are ways in which you can say the system moved, but you can't say the whole cart moved but there are examples were system growth and system change really did play out"
[00:57:28.10],Liz,"Yeah, yes I would not dispute that at all. And also a lot of, when we focused on teachers, which is what we did with new terrain pay off wont really show up immediately, you gotta wait for the plant to grow before it yields flower you know, so those are more long term, you wont see the change systemically or in a large scale until there are enough free service teacher in school district that have gone through new kind of separation courses at both different institution, we reached in our project will take several years before we start to see um you know a wave happen and we knew that, we knew that at the time so, we don't have great ways to hold the high schools accountable for shifting to next gen science, so that's, that's sort of its own separate animal, if you succeed by middle school and get kids to understand how to think like a scientist, that science is a verb and not a noun, you know it's something you do, something you figure out, you scratch you head, you come at it in a different way, you piece it together, if more middle school kids experience science learning that way, so that few of them are turned off and more of them are turned on to this is interesting, I can do this then that would be a huge success, we have indirect ways of measuring that, you know by the time those middle schoolers get into high school, do they take more AP courses, do they take science elective, we don't have great ways of tracking it's all kind of indirect because you're dealing with human beings and just because a kid decides to become a music major doesn't mean they had a bad science experience"
[00:59:51.14],Jean,No absolutely not
[00:59:52.03],Maggie,Right right
[00:59:52.03],Jean,"But many of the doctors and nurses and the X-ray technicians, that I speak to just in my private life and I often ask them, how did you get into this!? Why did you choose this? 9 times out of 10 they said I had an amazing, high school, teacher. Who made it so interesting, I had an amazing science teacher, just one. You know, that's the story"
[01:00:21.03],Jean,"That's sometimes all it takes and that's why, I feel that approaching and understand of NGSX by helping teachers change their pedagogy in science is important. I mean you can give them NGSS but it's just such a dry weed. "
[01:00:43.23],Liz,Yup
[01:00:43.20],Jean,"Help me here, this is a different, I am going to get excited about with my kids, but"
[01:00:51.09],Liz,"Exactly, exactly. And let them seize on to at least a part of it, kids thinking and expressing their thoughts, that would be great, instead just talking about nonsense. Question 6, could you speak to the experiences of diversity with the hub groups, oh yeah there was a lot of diversity, any conjectures to why that might have bent the case? Maggie you feel that we have cover that?"
[01:01:26.27],Maggie,"Yeah, that was kind of my follow up question about the idea of leadership and if that might account for some of those differences, the kind of energy that the repliers brought, but if you still-- please yeah"
[01:01:42.09],Liz,"They were not designed to have leadership, we thought that NGSX was going to going to be the leader and then we learned that didn't work, so whatever leadership occurred was very sporadic personality dependent. That my conjecture"
[01:02:01.28],Jean,"Oh I think you're right on that I mean, at the end of the day it all goes back to the individual person"
[01:02:12.00],Liz,"Maggie, in year two and three we really had a whole different format for the professional learning, mainly the, sometimes we did a one week, sometimes we did a two week summer institute were we were all together everyday, and I was there and I set the tone every morning and I was there to go with the groups and we had a leadership team, yeah that's what we were, we were a leadership team, we were there, so I don't think there was anybody feeling like what the heck is this all about, and I am sure there were people who were trying to figure that out in the hubs because I wasn't there on the hubs, we couldn't be there were too many in too many parts of the state, so we tried to drop in when we could, that made a big difference so, "
[01:03:08.20],Jean,"Well we didn't have a cheerleader, in the state, sacred heart wasn't able to perform that role"
[01:03:17.12],Liz,Exactly
[01:03:23.05],Jean,"But you know one of my fondest memories of new terrain, it is sitting with the two kindergarten teachers, eventually three, who put together the corn unit and talking, and through dialogue, giving them permission to change what they had always come to understand science to be in first and second grade. "
[01:03:54.13],Liz,"Yeah, it was very invigorating."
[01:03:55.08],Jean,it was and once they have themselves permission to take it in a entirely new direction and it was all with this little experiment they had done in their class room and make something more of it for other kids
[01:04:18.27],Liz,"I don't think that they had change, that enlighten would have happened, had they had not been, remember how Bryan and Mike would schedule meetings and each group would come, they had direct dialogue questioning pressing do you think it's like, so without that component I think the units would have been pretty traditional looking, so I just felt that, that was so rewarding"
[01:04:57.12],Jean,"Well you might think about it this way, oh. A little bit more, it was a remarkable summer, I think it was the second week"
[01:05:16.18],Liz,"I should write that down, I loved what you just said, I should write that down. That will make me even happier in my retirement, it was a remarkable summer"
[01:05:27.02],Jean,It was good despite several explosions
[01:05:31.09],Liz,"Oh god yes, I didn't say I wanna re-live it, I wouldn't wanna relive it but it was remarkable summer in many ways "
[01:05:40.01],Jean, In many ways 
[01:05:41.04],Liz,"You know that was the, the other lesson you pull together, so many different personalities and so many different ways of thinking, there's bound to be rough buds, overall we can say change happens, it was a remarkable summer, I count that as a success, so when is this article gonna get written?"
[01:06:09.21],Jean,"I hope, that within the next month we have a draft"
[01:06:14.24],Liz,"Yeah, well are you and Maggie both writing or?"
[01:06:24.00],Jean,"We may send it to you, we may send it to Cindy, we might send it to some other people and have them road test it"
[01:06:32.00],Liz,"I will definitely be happy, to give you feedback, of course I am interested in how it all get's put together and what message comes of it, I but I think it's I appreciate it that you are interested in it enough to do all this work "
[01:06:53.27],Jean,"Well it's gonna be a project, we've had several things to write and so there's been a little bit of a competition for time but I think, we're writing an article for a book that's going to be published in Denmark, is it Maggie?"
[01:07:17.16],Maggie," I think Denmark or Sweden? One of the Nordic countries, I am not sure"
[01:07:23.14],Jean,"And it's about teacher agency and student agency in science teaching and learning and again we're pulling from projects that we have done and another thing that learned overtime that we focus the work around the development of agency and teachers, in service of them developing similar things in their student and looking at students from a assets perspective"
[01:07:59.25],Liz,"And not from a deficit, oh boy that's huge"
[01:08:03.05],Jean,Yeah
[01:08:03.24],Liz,That is huge and valuing differences
[01:08:08.17],Jean,And especially in this day and age when they is such great diversity in our country.
[01:08:18.01],Liz,"And you know what I am realizing, it's just not diversity in appearance or color or intellect but just different ways of seeing the world, like my grandson is 5 and half years old now, he's quite different than his younger sister, they both of course are brilliant you know gifted and all that but he asks questions, he has interesting insightful questions and I always say that's a really good question, hmm let's think about that. I fear for him and kids like that, school will extinguish that because teachers don't value questions, especially questions out of the box, his questions are not wacko but they are really, woah that's a really good question let's think about that, a lot of teachers don't have time, don't have the time, not have interest in your questions that's not what we're learning about today, just afraid that formal education will turn that off in him. I hope not. But that's another kind of diversity, diversity in how people think and how they express their thoughts, it's a really hard job being a teacher."
[01:09:42.00],Maggie,Yeah I admire you
[01:09:44.18],Jean,Cause we're learning that it's not a scripted profession
[01:09:48.16],Liz,"That's right, we're dealing with human beings"
[01:09:52.09],Jean,"There some people, teachers that still wanna follow a script, but they're not gonna help the Zach's of the world and so we have to provide kind of blueprint"
[01:10:06.18],Liz,We're here! Amen!
[01:10:07.08],Jean,We will let you know when the draft it ready 
[01:10:12.06],Liz,"Please do, please do and thank you for including me in the process, it's always fun to talk with you guys, you girls"
[01:10:20.24],Everyone,[Says thanks to one another]
