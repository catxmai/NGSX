00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.820
Anisha Hassan: Sounds like out

2
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.700
Anisha Hassan: Um, yeah. I also took a nap.

3
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530
Anisha Hassan: I'm gonna pause the recording. Oh no. Yeah.

4
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.870
Jess Zaleski: I just

5
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.850
Jess Zaleski: Decided to just freeze itself and shut itself down right as I'm about to lock. So then I had to grab my Chrome

6
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.460
Jess Zaleski: Why

7
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.790
Anisha Hassan: Yeah so yesterday night there was a knee from your class that I logged it like twice, and I was just like, or

8
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.240
Anisha Hassan: Anything I was like I should I go in, but they left in like about my community.

9
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:33.330
Jess Zaleski: I wondered how many of them would test the link out because they were nervous because it zoom as opposed. I got a couple emails today, like Mrs. Zoom going to work on my Chromebook. I'm like, it should, you know,

10
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.090
Anisha Hassan: Yeah.

11
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.340
Jess Zaleski: Well see,

12
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.650
Jess Zaleski: I didn't see any of them today because we only have one class on Fridays. So

13
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.670
Jess Zaleski: We'll see what happens.

14
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.460
Yeah.

15
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.100
Jess Zaleski: I Sarah.

16
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.330
Sarah Michaels: Right there.

17
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.430
Sarah Michaels: I'm nervous.

18
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.050
Jess Zaleski: Why

19
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.260
Sarah Michaels: It's crazy.

20
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.790
Sarah Michaels: I

21
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.010
Jess Zaleski: Don't say that. You'll make me nervous and I

22
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.230
Sarah Michaels: Feel. Oh my god. You're my total. No, I just

23
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.930
Sarah Michaels: I mean, I'm so excited.

24
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:35.580
Jess Zaleski: Sue and I just met again like an hour ago when we were just going over everything, and we added a few things I we both think that we won't get past the individual model drawing ideas today. That's, that's where we think we're going to end up based on um

25
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.540
Jess Zaleski: Yeah. So it'll be interesting to see.

26
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.730
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, it'll be what it is and it'll be fun and it'll be fine. It'll be great. I just can't wait to meet the kids.

27
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.370
Anisha Hassan: So one breakout room then just the two for the norms. Right.

28
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.230
Jess Zaleski: Just to breakout rooms for the norms, and I think that's all we're gonna need um

29
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:13.410
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, I was after hear your story about not being put in a breakout room for 15 minutes. I was like, oh my god, what if I mess this one thing up and they're stuck somewhere and can to get into the breakout room.

30
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:28.530
Jess Zaleski: Oh, see you guys can't even imagine the technical issues we deal with on a daily basis. So I mean, half the time. You never even know if you're just talking to yourself, or if they can even hear you. Because nobody speaks right

31
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.430
Sarah Michaels: This will be different.

32
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.300
Jess Zaleski: This will be very different. I'm looking for my other mouse.

33
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.810
Anisha Hassan: So since I need you to co host Jess probably get a link to the recording afterwards.

34
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.890
Jess Zaleski: Okay, that's fine.

35
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.830
Jess Zaleski: I'm going to now that my Mac booted back up. I'm going to log in on that one. As soon as it goes through, but

36
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.350
Sarah Michaels: I'm gonna go. I'm just look at the kids names on that list.

37
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.470
Jess Zaleski: Raquel. I have a question for you because I'm you know

38
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:52.920
Jess Zaleski: I always feel awful when we ask a student how to say their name and if we don't pronounce it exactly right. The first time I want them to keep correcting me. But

39
00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:06.840
Jess Zaleski: You know, out of respect. It's fine. It's, you know, and I want them so badly to advocate for the correct pronunciation of their name. So this is I'm not. I'm going to try to say it again. How would you say that name Raquel

40
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.100
Raquel Fernandes: So it's a really unusual name and never, I've never seen it before.

41
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.770
Raquel Fernandes: So I wouldn't know exactly

42
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.330
Jess Zaleski: Okay, so I even call

43
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:29.010
Jess Zaleski: I've been calling her Catlin man never corrected me she, you know what I mean. And as to sue. Now one of her teachers calls her Kathleen

44
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.770
Jess Zaleski: But would that have that, like, oh, here's Landrieu

45
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.220
Jess Zaleski: Highly Andrew

46
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.050
Jess Zaleski: Is hi

47
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:52.380
Jess Zaleski: We can hear you. You so the Zoom is working on. We're not going to get started. For another 10 minutes but I'm so glad that you tried out the link to make sure it works. Okay, there you are. Early Andrew. Awesome.

48
00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:03.690
Jess Zaleski: Um, so Leandra we're just going to meet for a few more minutes just to get prepared. So if you can just sign off and then just a couple minutes before three o'clock. Why don't you log back in. Okay.

49
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.620
Leandro Graterol: Yeah, sure.

50
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.090
Jess Zaleski: Okay, awesome. We'll see you in about eight minutes. Okay. All right, bye Leandro

51
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.520
Jess Zaleski: Okay that's Lee Andrew who we told you, you would all love and you will because he is so cool. So, um,

52
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.200
Sue: How do I change the format of zoom like where's that button.

53
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:30.120
Anisha Hassan: And so if you go to the top, there's the single view. So if you click on it, you can see everybody at the same time.

54
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.670
Sue: That's what I was trying struggling with. Okay, good. Thank you.

55
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.110
Sue: I have zero experience with zoom. So I was panicking. So

56
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.250
Sarah Michaels: Just ask. And, you know, and everybody will actually have this issue too. So we're probably gonna have to teach them. Yeah.

57
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:57.120
Jess Zaleski: I think, and I think we should teach them like where if we can, like, Wait, how do you get a virtual background because they might not know how to do that and zoom and that might help them to feel more comfortable so

58
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.320
Yeah.

59
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.050
Anisha Hassan: Wait, I forgot how to do that myself.

60
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.570
Anisha Hassan: Is just

61
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.590
On video

62
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.310
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, I think under the meal the cog.

63
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.530
Alma Araujo: Wheel, I think. Yeah. Got it. I opened the program, I think.

64
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.180
Jess Zaleski: Yeah, you have to open the program. I don't think you can get from it the video window.

65
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.430
What do you mean, open the program.

66
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:41.340
Raquel Fernandes: So in the same button of stop video there isn't like arrow pointing upwards. And then if you click there. You can choose virtual background.

67
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.320
Jess Zaleski: Oh video settings. There it is. Video settings. I'll see mine doesn't show that

68
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:46.890
That

69
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.570
Jess Zaleski: My

70
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.250
Jess Zaleski: limited options. Yeah.

71
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.100
Anisha Hassan: Right. So if you're logged into the Clark one

72
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.560
Anisha Hassan: Then you get get like Clark backgrounds.

73
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.360
Anisha Hassan: And like a lot of other stuff.

74
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.170
Anisha Hassan: I don't know what like just regular zoom has like maybe two or three backgrounds itself will

75
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.810
Sue: has another one, or is that the clock one

76
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.120
Anisha Hassan: No, not the corn. Corn, I think.

77
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:17.160
Sarah Michaels: That's just the one that that I have an option for, oh, well, we'll figure it out. I think it also might create

78
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.910
Sarah Michaels: It might, it might affect the Internet.

79
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.510
Sarah Michaels: But we

80
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.180
Sarah Michaels: We can we can see. And yeah, so

81
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:32.130
Jess Zaleski: I don't think we need to do it today. It's probably gonna with the student Chromebooks create a lot of lag. So yeah, I don't think it's um

82
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.940
Sue: All of this all of our students have seen my my lovely room here, quote unquote, lovely room doesn't matter.

83
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.140
Jess Zaleski: I mean, I look

84
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.540
Jess Zaleski: At about six years.

85
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.710
Sue: I live. It's on the whiteboard.

86
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.700
Jess Zaleski: Look at you.

87
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.300
Sarah Michaels: I love

88
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.450
Sue: That's all I that's it that's as good as it's gonna get

89
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.480
Jess Zaleski: So question because I'm still not 100% sure how we agreed to handle this.

90
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:10.200
Jess Zaleski: When we go into the two breakout rooms for the group norms are we going to use the jam board then and like sue your group takes one frame and my group takes a second frame.

91
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:22.560
Jess Zaleski: And we encourage the kids to put their ideas down or we add sticky notes or are we just talking about it and then creating one collaborative jam board after

92
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.540
Jess Zaleski: I'm thinking it

93
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.100
Sue: Might be better just to talk first few minutes

94
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.940
Jess Zaleski: Okay, that's what I envisioned. And then we come back together and everybody shares out and we put sticky notes. Okay.

95
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.320
Sue: What I was thinking

96
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.870
Sarah Michaels: Okay, so, because most of the students are

97
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.560
Sue: Ours, and I know how they function in the class.

98
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.690
Sarah Michaels: So here

99
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.890
Sarah Michaels: So here's a

100
00:09:48.870 --> 00:10:08.040
Sarah Michaels: Here's a reason to do it with the the jam board, it would give them some practice using jam board writing a sticky. They can try to write a sticky, we can, but so if you bring them if you bring them back and then you created

101
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.450
Sarah Michaels: ideas together, would you be writing the stickies or would they would you share

102
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.250
Sarah Michaels: You know,

103
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:23.340
Jess Zaleski: I don't know. I think we could do it either way. I think we could if they share an idea, we could say, could you add that to the jam board.

104
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.350
Sarah Michaels: Okay, so everybody would have access

105
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:33.390
Jess Zaleski: If everybody would I put the link in the chat and then everybody would have access to it or you think it would be less intimidating to do these separately.

106
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:40.110
Sue: In the smaller groups, could you please add like in my group, could you please add that to a sticky the sticky notes right here.

107
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:46.080
Jess Zaleski: Yeah, so, so we can do that. And then I mean we'll use the same word, what

108
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.520
Sue: How would you combine them as

109
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.480
Jess Zaleski: Well, no. It's just we wouldn't we would take a look at group ones and say, group one

110
00:10:51.900 --> 00:11:03.360
Jess Zaleski: You know, why don't group one's going to share with group to what you guys came up with and then group to we're going to share with group one and then is there a lot of overlap, let's kind of eliminate combine condense

111
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.920
Jess Zaleski: The problem with that is you can't move sticky notes from one frame to another. No.

112
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:21.210
Sarah Michaels: Well, then maybe let's not maybe stick with your, your regular idea of talking it through and then coming together and i t shirt and a half to make sure that somebody recording the students ideas.

113
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.540
Jess Zaleski: Yes, yelling at each of those meats. So who's going to do that.

114
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.130
Anisha Hassan: One RA will be there up so we can do that.

115
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.780
Sue: That would be awesome. Yeah.

116
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.320
Anisha Hassan: Good Heikki Sean

117
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.000
Jess Zaleski: Hi key, Sean.

118
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.240
Jess Zaleski: Do we have a waiting room setup.

119
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.740
Anisha Hassan: Do you want me to do that.

120
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.530
Anisha Hassan: Yes. Okay, now we get the kids come in early, then yeah wait around in there.

121
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.150
Anisha Hassan: So you're still that they're connected that it's probably testing it to make sure it's working.

122
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.640
Sarah Michaels: So john is on right

123
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.840

227
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:57.960
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

228
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.010

Jessica Zaleski: Oh, somebody is trying to call me from school. So let me just take that one moment.

233
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.250
Sarah Michaels: Everybody knows how to get to gallery view.

234
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.560
Sarah Michaels: Nisha maybe

235
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:38.010
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, so if you guys see like top corner there's something called view. And if you click on that, you should be able to see like small boxes. So in gallery view, depending on the size of your screen, though it might be to like two parts or like every you can see everyone at the same time.

236
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.340
Anisha Hassan: So did you get it.

237
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.050
Sue: I see 16 squares at the same time. Yeah.

238
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.370
Anisha Hassan: So that is depending on the screen. You can be 16

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.720
Sue: See. Isn't it kind of fun to see everybody's pictures on

257
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:17.370
Jessica Zaleski: It really is. It's way more interesting than little black dots that we look at all day so boring. When you're just a black square

258
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.350
Sue: I don't know about you guys, but I'm really excited.

259
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:19.860
Jessica Zaleski: I am

260
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.200
Jessica Zaleski: The most exciting thing that's happened to this school year.

261
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:41.520
Sue: Thank you so much for participating in this. This is really gonna. This is, I know, Mrs de and I actually spoke about this a lot, saying it's been a tough year and and this is really our highlight

262
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:54.120
Sue: We're really hoping that this is going to recharge us to kind of work with students in this environment, however long, we have to do it. So thank you so much for actually doing this with us.

263
00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:00.360
Jessica Zaleski: It's going to be fun. Does everyone have their science kit with them. Okay, awesome.

264
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:10.800
Jessica Zaleski: So I think let's see mistake. I think we're just missing Elio and who else super

265
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.370
Leandro Graterol: Nice. I'm gonna turn on my camera for just one second. Yeah.

266
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:32.490
Jessica Zaleski: 1213 I think it's just LL because we've got 13 students in here. So he would be 14 so. Okay. All right. So hopefully he have his number, maybe, um, I do. I can email him. I don't know.

267
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.540
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, usually I just thought that you texted me you're in

268
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.710
Sue: Alright, cool.

269
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.800
Jessica Zaleski: So let me see if I've got number. I don't think so. But I can try.

270
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.540
Sue: I know I don't have it so.

271
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.610
Maybe that might be something that we want to do is maybe compile

272
00:21:51.660 --> 00:22:01.590
Sue: Numbers that we can get in touch with you all individually, because I know we had a lot of parents phone numbers. I know when I tried to call or text me

273
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:09.480
Sue: Or sorry, Nikki I had her mom's number so she gave me her number. So it was a little bit easier to get in touch with each other. You case.

274
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:20.640
Sue: everybody forgets every once in a while. Right. But in case in case there's any issues with internet you can kind of Texas, real quick, it's probably easier to do that in case you have internet issues, obviously.

275
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.400
Jessica Zaleski: So you leave that Elliot doesn't have his phone.

276
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.080
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. He is actually in touch with aliens are you in touch with him Uli

277
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.470
Jessica Zaleski: What, what, where's the chat room. Is that not not RN right now.

278
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.330
Sue: too old to figure this out. Okay. Not really. I'm

279
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.290
Jessica Zaleski: Not right now.

280
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.760
Sue: I think, oh,

281
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:59.070
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. Well, I mean, I did. He did, email me today. Oh, did we just got somebody else my screen keeps changing.

282
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.810
Jessica Zaleski: I think that's just Edwin, Edwin Uli and

283
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.800
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, I've got

284
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:18.150
Jessica Zaleski: Got, got some contact information for him. So we before we do like our first

285
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:27.480
Jessica Zaleski: Big group kind of introduction, we thought, Misty and I thought it would be good to introduce all of you students

286
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:39.000
Jessica Zaleski: To the adults in the group. Okay. Because there are definitely some adults in here that you've never seen before. And you might be wondering, like who are these people. So we'd like all the

287
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:49.380
Jessica Zaleski: Adults to just introduce themselves and share a little bit about themselves and then you will get to participate in the activity there are enough slides for everyone to create a slide.

288
00:23:49.770 --> 00:24:01.620
Jessica Zaleski: But just to make everyone make the students feel comfortable just wanted to introduce so should you and I go first or because I know, yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Mistake. Okay.

289
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.760
So,

290
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:18.180
Sue: The only new students that I met today when I dropped off the lab kit was Nikki, so everyone else. I know you're either in my biology class with Mrs Alaska or you're in my biology class.

291
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:28.260
Sue: That I have by myself. So there isn't a whole lot. I don't think that you know about me because I like to talk about everything that I'm doing at home because I'm kind of bored.

292
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:41.640
Sue: But just in case you're not aware. I've been teaching itself for 21 years biology. I've taught some anatomy some chemistry and some AP Environmental Science. So I if you

293
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:53.790
Sue: Can't tell. I really love science. So don't be afraid to ask any questions or ask me anything. I'm really open to anything. Okay.

294
00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:02.460
Jessica Zaleski: All right, this is a. All right. Alright, so I'm this is the last key and I been at South. Hi, this is my fifth year teaching at South. Hi.

295
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:16.290
Jessica Zaleski: I am prime. Well, I used to primarily be an ESL teacher English as a second language, but for the last, this is my third year teaching with Miss nay co teaching biology.

296
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:31.650
Jessica Zaleski: And I also co teach geometry. And so that's why I am working in the biology classes this year to just to support all the students, but primarily the English language learners.

297
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:42.390
Jessica Zaleski: And I mean you guys all know me me Nicki. It's so nice to meet you, Reggie. So nice to meet you, everyone else's knows me. It was so fun.

298
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:49.890

299
00:25:50.370 --> 00:26:02.880

334
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:53.910
Jessica Zaleski: Sarah say Sue and Joss and that's fine. So just in case you weren't sure you've probably seen my name, but I'm jus Mrs de su okay so it's okay you know that you're going to hear. It's just easier because we're used to calling each other by first names so

335
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.420
Sue: This is a really cool opportunity to actually call us buyer.

336
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:07.230
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly. So you can call us, Mrs de emphasis on air. You can call us Justin Sue, it's fine either way. We're all in this together. Okay, so whatever you're comfortable with and whatever comes out first. Okay.

337
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:13.050
Jessica Zaleski: So instead of you guys all having to unmute and Share yourself,

338
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:26.970
Jessica Zaleski: Share out loud. We're going to just spend some time working on a little Google slide deck where you can share some information about yourselves. Okay, so I'm going to put a link to a Google slide deck in the chat.

339
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:36.360
Jessica Zaleski: This is going to be interesting because I think there's like 25 different slides in there and everybody just has to pick a slide. Okay, so if you're on a slide.

340
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:42.990
Jessica Zaleski: And somebody, you know, you go to a slide where somebody already on that slide move to a different slide. There's enough slides for everyone.

341
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.980
Jessica Zaleski: Find a slide. And it's just going to ask you to share three things that you really like like three of your favorite things.

342
00:31:50.370 --> 00:32:06.060
Jessica Zaleski: Three things you really don't like just some like basic information so we can get to know you going to ask you to put a little picture in this slide. So I'm going to put the link to that in. Now let me just get that ready I'm gonna, I'm going to ask if everybody's

343
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:15.180
Sue: If anybody's ever seen this old house Bob Vila asks the silly questions I'm going to ask the silly zoom questions okay because I'm old.

344
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.940
Sue: How do I get to the chat.

345
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.750
Sue: I don't see the chat in zoom

346
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:35.100
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, so if you go to the bottom there like a lot of kings call stop video mute, there should be a chat, like a chat function as well. It's usually beside share screen. I found it.

347
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.380
Sue: I didn't see it.

348
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.270
Sue: Thank you.

349
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:54.000
Jessica Zaleski: Alright everyone, so here is a link to the slide deck. Let's see if everyone can get in there just find a slide that no one's taken and go ahead and type your name in and

350
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:54.840
Jessica Zaleski: We'll give

351
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.370
Jessica Zaleski: You guys about 15

352
00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:05.940
Jessica Zaleski: Minutes to work on this. And then we'll all be able to take a look at it after. Okay, so if you want to turn your camera off right now while you're working that's perfectly fine. Okay.

353
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:29.700
Sue: I'm just gonna let the kids all pick their video. Their, their slides first and then I'll just take one minute stopping us

354
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.180
Anisha Hassan: Are the adults doing it too.

355
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.620
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, everyone's doing it.

356
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.870
Sue: You didn't notice any, should there was a whole bunch of slides, I'm like she was thinking ahead.

357
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.120
Good Ricky's already on one

358
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.230
Sue: So put your name right away that

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:36.420
Sue: We can see the next. Right, Sarah.

362
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:16.920
Jessica Zaleski: So if you're having any problems getting into the slide deck, just type in the chat and let us know. It looks like there's 20 people in here. I think there's 20 in 23 participants. So just let us know if you're having any difficulty getting into the slide deck. Okay.

363
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.810
Sue: Everybody's so focused love it.

364
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.870
Leandro Graterol: Yes, I'm trying to find something that I don't like. Like, it's really hard.

365
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.620
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, I had to think about this one.

366
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.810
Jessica Zaleski: It could be a food. Yeah, I picked up food now things that

367
00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:03.690
salam: People do yeah knowing. Yeah. It could be anything when there's a question that says what is the thing you do like

368
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:11.100
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, there's, there's the first question. Well, first is three of your favorite things. And then it's three things you don't like.

369
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.150
Oh,

370
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.400
salam: I rubbed the wrong thing.

371
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.450
Okay.

372
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.180
Jessica Zaleski: May I love yours.

373
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.390
Jessica Zaleski: Like my sorting saw

374
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.070
Sue: My god yeah yeah might. Yeah.

375
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.180
Jessica Zaleski: That's my true so true.

376
00:40:53.880 --> 00:41:00.660
Because my one of my favorite things is a picture is worth 1000 words. So I like to every time I hand.

377
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:22.230
Jessica Zaleski: I love being able to see how everybody's working now.

378
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.980
Jessica Zaleski: So awesome. Yeah.

379
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:40.650
Sue: Now, if anybody's having trouble with the picture of you remember if you just click on insert

380
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:53.820
Sue: Image, then you can click on the camera button and then just look at the camera on your Chromebook and click the camera button and it will actually take that picture and they can choose the best picture of you because I had to take my

381
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.890
Jessica Zaleski: God, that's what I just did. I was

382
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.160
Jessica Zaleski: Not going to try to find I'm not much of a selfie taker.

383
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:08.880
Jessica Zaleski: as shocking as that might be. But I've only taken one selfie of my life in my life. I probably should have turned up the brightness because I look like I'm in a cave, but that's okay.

384
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.020
Jessica Zaleski: So do we want to say like, about three more minutes for this. Yeah.

385
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.220
Sue: Would you like me to set the timer.

386
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.140
Jessica Zaleski: Sure, I don't. All right, everyone. So, but just about three more minutes to finish this up.

387
00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.630
Sue: And I guess at any point if somebody was not happy with theirs. They could always change. Oh.

388
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.900
Yeah.

389
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.460
But it's kind of nice because it will have something we can actually look back on.

390
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.850
Jessica Zaleski: To, if we can, if we forget what somebody looks

391
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:16.980
Like you can just kind of look back and it helps us to know each other's names and to associate the name with the person that we're actually speaking to

392
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:32.340
Sue: Because I think we told most of our students at this the pictures, we're looking at in Sage are probably from elementary school or middle school and none of you look that way.

393
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:36.900
Jessica Zaleski: I know it is kind of funny looking at some of those pictures.

394
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.530
Jessica Zaleski: I'm not sure the students even realize, you know what

395
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.160
Sue: Maybe if we actually showed them. What was still there, they'd actually changed their picture.

396
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:51.810
Jessica Zaleski: Well, I don't know if they can. I don't think they can change their picture and sage.

397
00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:02.340
Jessica Zaleski: Well yeah now misspells you're saying no, thank you. Yeah, that that what I don't understand is why it doesn't get updated when we do school pictures. I mean,

398
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:03.570
Sue: Make sense right

399
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.880
Jessica Zaleski: You would think that some of these kids, Miss picture day since the third grade because you know

400
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:13.380
Jessica Zaleski: Like

401
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.760
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, I know Elio likes motocross so it's got to be him.

402
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.370
Sue: I've only written one once and I will hit a tree.

403
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.180
Yeah.

404
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:41.310
Reggie: I miss it might take a while for the picture in because it's got the picture big to my phone is taking a long time to process.

405
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.510
Yeah.

406
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.590
Sue: You could always add years in after

407
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.130
Jessica Zaleski: So,

408
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.670
Sue: It's one that you really like. It's like your favorite photo you can add an after

409
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.580
We have about a minute and a half left

410
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.610
Jessica Zaleski: Awesome Catlin.

411
00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.930
Jessica Zaleski: Hi, Cal, what type of dog do you have

412
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.080
Raquel Fernandes: An Australian Shepherd.

413
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.330
Jessica Zaleski: So do I. Have we ever talked about this before.

414
00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:58.950
Raquel Fernandes: I do know.

415
00:47:59.040 --> 00:47:59.400
Um, I

416
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.960
Jessica Zaleski: Was looking at the picture. I'm like, I think that's an Aussie I have a

417
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.970
Jessica Zaleski: I have a red neural

418
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.770
Jessica Zaleski: with blue eyes like I'll get her.

419
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.410
Jessica Zaleski: She's really cute. She's been D is her name. So, yeah.

420
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.350
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yes, I love on

421
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.290
Sue: I also do not like clowns. I should have put that in.

422
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.930
Jessica Zaleski: I put clowns key Sean kindred spirit.

423
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.190
Jessica Zaleski: I hate cloud.

424
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:31.380
Sue: I think we talked about it in class in class because we talked about that old movie it that came up when we were kid when I was a kid.

425
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:37.440
Jessica Zaleski: But, well, that's when we played the scavenger hunt and somebody said something

426
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:40.200
Jessica Zaleski: Gary and they held up one of those masks and

427
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.850
Jessica Zaleski: That was enough for me.

428
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.960
Sue: If you've heard that timer that is the end of our time.

429
00:48:46.260 --> 00:49:06.180
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so you can absolutely later on, go in and edit this, I think, just so we keep everybody on track what I'll do is I'm just going to lock this slideshow for now. Okay. And, and I will unlock it again later. So if you want to tweak it, like after later on. That's perfectly fine. But let me

430
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: Let me just change the sharing permissions here.

431
00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:12.780
And

432
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:18.480
Sue: Then on the wrong, you're not used to working with these windows here.

433
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:21.720
Sue: I didn't even know you could lock a slide deck.

434
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.670
Jessica Zaleski: So I just learned so well if you

435
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.860
I think if I just go to restricted.

436
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.720
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, they have the link. So I don't know if this will work the same way as a jam board.

437
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:35.700
Might not

438
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:42.480
Jessica Zaleski: They've got the lingo. So why doesn't everybody just close out of it for right now.

439
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.530
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so that we can move on.

440
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.470
Jessica Zaleski: We will go on to the next activity.

441
00:49:54.450 --> 00:50:11.280
Jessica Zaleski: So Now's a great time for you to turn your cameras back on, make sure that you have your notebook and a pen or pencil ready with you and we're actually going to be going into breakout rooms to talk a little bit about

442
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:31.800
Jessica Zaleski: Something called norms. I'm just going to type that in the chat. Okay, so let's talk for a second about norms. Does anybody think they know what I'm talking about. If I say group or class norms. What do you think that means

443
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.560
Reggie: You do like all the time.

444
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.680
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right, and gals.

445
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:39.600
Nhi Huynh: Through in a class.

446
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.980
Sue: You have to blows. Cool.

447
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.150
Jessica Zaleski: Excellent. Nikki. Yeah.

448
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.590
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah alright so miss the were no arms forums. If you can't, so if

449
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:58.620
Sue: At the bottom of your screen there is a little it lights up yellow. It's a little box at the bottom and you can click on that you can actually see the chat. It pulls it up.

450
00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.390
salam: Now, I think it means something like you do all the time.

451
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:10.590
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, yeah. So that's exactly right. So we're going to talk about what we think the norms should be

452
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:24.840
Jessica Zaleski: For our group for our virtual science pod. Like, what are some things that we should all agree to do or ways we should all agree to interact with one another so

453
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:36.030
Jessica Zaleski: You're going to be going into a breakout room with either miss. Nay, or me and some of the, some of our other leaders, we're just going to kind of divide you in half.

454
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.040
Jessica Zaleski: And we're just going to have a conversation

455
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:47.460
Jessica Zaleski: And you guys get to talk about, like, what do you think the rules and norms for this should be okay. So I think this

456
00:51:47.700 --> 00:52:01.500
Sue: This is about this isn't just about the teachers and the Clark teachers and arias. This is about you all. So we're we want your feedback as to what you think this

457
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:07.500
Sue: This virtual finance pod should be how it should work together.

458
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:09.990
The best way possible.

459
00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.090
Anisha Hassan: Yeah. Should I open the breakout rooms.

460
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.850
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, okay. So in each is going to invite everybody to our breakout room. So just go ahead and join when you get that invitation. Okay.

461
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.930
Ms. B's guest: This one's just my backup. So I'll just stay in the main session for this one.

462
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.780
Okay.

463
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:11.340
Jessica Zaleski: Well, I'm back here. Okay. All right, so I'm, I'm just gonna put it back in the chat. Okay. Oh, it should be in the chat above in Google meet you lose the chat. Every time you go back and forth. So this is nice that

464
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:31.050
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And if you need to see the slides and the zoom session at the same time, you can exit full screen and then you can see it on the opposite side of your window if you need to move for a moment.

465
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:34.620
Jessica Zaleski: I'm going to get up and stretch my legs for one second.

466
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:36.990
Sue: Well needed break

467
01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:48.930
Sue: Curious to see what the other group came up with.

468
01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.190
Leandro

469
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:03.000
Is this that so did

470
01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:06.690
This is he just put a new link up there right

471
01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:14.850
Reggie: Yeah.

472
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:21.720
Who's singing

473
01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:31.950
Jessica Zaleski: Right.

474
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.190
Reggie: Maybe embarrass myself.

475
01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.460
Sue: Very nicely.

476
01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.380
I want one of those microphones.

477
01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:53.700
Sue: That's awesome. I know.

478
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.880
Sue: But I need the headphones to because it just looks like I get to play the part because I have it all.

479
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:00.570
Really

480
01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:05.610
Sue: Absolutely like got Miss Belcher right

481
01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:10.800
Sue: Going to have those looks like you're like in a fly a plane or something.

482
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:25.020
Jessica Zaleski: I was using those last spring, because I didn't have a good set. I didn't like my air, you know, iPhone bad. So I was using my son's gaming headset to do all my Google meats and I I did feel like air traffic control for

483
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:28.200
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yes, this is definitely the world of fortnight.

484
01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:34.800
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yes, right now. Yes. And I have a larger size head. Anyway, so it's definitely not helping with that.

485
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:36.930
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: But it's okay.

486
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:53.880
Jessica Zaleski: So need just put in the chat. I can't use my Chromebook, because the camera is broken. We're going to use my iPad. Okay, so you know what NE NE I will email you a link to the slide deck right now to your email. Okay.

487
01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:54.780
Sue: Really you

488
01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.740
Jessica Zaleski: Got it from zoom. So I will email that right over to you.

489
01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:04.830
Sue: Now, why, why does that happen is that just because it's a different program that

490
01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:12.690
Jessica Zaleski: Will if she's on zoom on our iPad, she can't get that link to the slide deck over to her Chromebook. Okay.

491
01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.540
See

492
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:43.140
Anisha Hassan: Me. I've also done this before, where I'm just on zoom into different like I'm on my phone and my computer. So I can use my like laptop for slides and links and then use the camera of my phone. That's a good idea.

493
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:52.050
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Say I'm practicing it. Now, if you see I have to presence in here I'm appear and then I have a guest of myself. Also, I've clones myself I

494
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:56.250
Jessica Zaleski: Did it. I was wondering who the guest was. I'm like, Is this guests going to make an appearance.

495
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:57.690
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I guess this me

496
01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.060
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: The guest this me I'm here twice. I've clone to

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:00.660
Myself.

498
01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:17.940
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, gosh. Okay. All right. So I think what we're going to do now. Can everyone just to make sure we're back. Can everyone just check in here. Say hi on. Turn your camera on. I knew you can join by Chromebooks, certainly you can. Yep.

499
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:22.110
Jessica Zaleski: All right, let's just make sure everyone's here.

500
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:33.600
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And just as a quick test to make sure that the chat menu is working. Everyone type a happy word inside of the chat. Just go, just flood flood the chat.

501
01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.450
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Just let those words flow ice cream.

508
01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.420
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, okay.

509
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:18.360
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so I think what we're going to do now is we're going to kind of pull and put together our ideas from the breakout rooms into a jam board together. So I'm going to put the link for the jam board in the chat.

510
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:25.980
Jessica Zaleski: I think I set it up so it's open for everyone just

511
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:32.550
Sue: If you have to go down to the chat and click on that button at the bottom. So you can see the chat pop up on your screen.

512
01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.900
It's a little different in zoom than it is in Google meeting.

513
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:43.950
Jessica Zaleski: Right. Looks like a lot of you are in there.

514
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:49.260
Jessica Zaleski: That's great. Okay. And I'm just going to

Jessica Zaleski: Okay, no problem. So we have 14 students and then

521
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:37.290
Jessica Zaleski: I think seven adults. Right. So I think there's 21 there should be 21 of US total. Okay, so it looks like there are about 13 of us in the jam board. So go ahead and click that link.

522
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:49.290
Jessica Zaleski: So four plus 1318 oh there's 18 okay sorry 13 yeah I had no no I was looking at the wrong number. Alright, so, um, I think, why don't we just

523
01:21:49.860 --> 01:22:02.460
Jessica Zaleski: Ask you guys think about what we talked about in our groups. What are some of the things that we should and should not do.

524
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:20.010
Jessica Zaleski: In the virtual science pod when we're talking about how we interact with each other, some of the behaviors we do go ahead and get a sticky note over on the left. Okay, and we're just going to ask you to write on a sticky note like

525
01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:30.750
Jessica Zaleski: What should we do what's important. What should we not do. Okay, and just type it on a sticky note and put your name on the sticky note, just so we can see

526
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:40.140
Jessica Zaleski: Who's sharing what and it's okay if you're, if you put the same idea. Somebody else that's fine. Yeah. Okay. Yep, just go ahead, whatever you think okay

527
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:53.070
Sue: Where did a little bit differently. We might decide that we can change the wording, a little bit. So everybody just throw down your ideas. If you don't know where the sticky note is on the left, the left side, the menu right below.

528
01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.230
That black with white arrow below that.

529
01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:33.870
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Look at all these. This is great. Yes. Very good. Thank you for spacing them out.

530
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.540
salam: I'm back. What do we have to do.

531
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:53.340
Jessica Zaleski: So we're just sharing. A salaam what we think our group norms should be in the virtual science pod. What should we do, what should we not do in this group. Oh, OK. OK.

532
01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:54.870
salam: You have to type anything

533
01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:06.120
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, just grab a go ahead and create a sticky note and write down your idea and I did I put some in there just to, you know, what we were talking about

534
01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.210
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

535
01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.890
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And the sticky note, remember, is right under the arrow huh

536
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:18.990
Leandro Graterol: Yes. Um, I don't know what these this is a problem or something.

537
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:27.060
Leandro Graterol: When I'm putting on a sticky note, I don't know what happened. He like he just laid my sticky note, I don't know.

538
01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:33.300
Jessica Zaleski: Sometimes what happens is Leandra someone will create a sticky note and it will go on top of your sticky know

539
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:40.590
Jessica Zaleski: So you might have to try to like, move it around a little bit. Sometimes people move them also and

540
01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:42.600
Jessica Zaleski: They disappear. Okay.

541
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.660
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And also, always make sure that you save it when you

542
01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:53.550
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Once you write it on the right hand side, there's a little Save button and when you click Save it should pop up on your screen. As long as someone didn't

543
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.160
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Put one on top of your swag.

544
01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:06.360
Sue: And a way to to avoid that is to change the color. So if you change the color to something else. You'll be able to see somebody else's behind you. Mm hmm.

545
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:17.700
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, I like to use different colors just makes it more interesting, alright, so few more seconds here to share your thoughts.

546
01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:28.260
Oh,

547
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:33.450
Illegal found up. How did you find a white. I didn't know white was even an option.

548
01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.300
Jessica Zaleski: That's the no color one

549
01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:37.230
Jessica Zaleski: At the end

550
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:41.370
Sue: Sorry, I never even saw that. See you taught me something.

551
01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:43.530
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you, Leo.

556
01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.990
Jessica Zaleski: The year yeah

557
01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:21.990
Jessica Zaleski: So if we want to talk about, like, what are some words that you're seeing that keep coming up over and over again, when you're looking at this jam board. What are some words that you are seeing repeated.

558
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:23.790
Well,

559
01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.240

Sue: And. LAUGH Yeah, that's a that's

567
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.760
A lot of people

568
01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:05.910
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, and we were talking about in our group, like what are some signs of disrespect for each other and laughing at each other was definitely something we talked about

569
01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:13.950
Jessica Zaleski: I rolling or having side conversations in the chat or via with texting each other, you know,

570
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:27.120
Jessica Zaleski: Mrs. Miss B and I were talking about how you can tell Mrs. Today, even in one of our staff meetings with adults. If you say something and then you see some teachers, looking down and laughing. You can tell that they're texting each other and

571
01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.710
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And then, yeah.

572
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:37.170
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly. You know, I mean, so even adults do it and it still i mean you know I'm 43 years old and it still hurts my feelings when

573
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.670
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Definitely stings. A little bit, yeah. Yeah, so it's

574
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.710
Sue: Not just kids your age, it's it's every it's a human, it bothers humans.

575
01:27:46.740 --> 01:28:07.980
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, it's a good, a good behavior to avoid. Yeah. And the fact is, like, this is a great opportunity for us to practice. What is it like to be in a respectful community with our peers working together. How should I be behaving in this group, you know. All right, so

576
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:18.780
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And always think of things that you don't like other people to do or things that don't feel good to you say if I don't like it done to me, Should I do it to someone else.

577
01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:26.340
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Oh, very good norms is a safe environment for you.

578
01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.680
Sue: All as students because we all want to be here.

579
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:30.330
Sue: So it's

580
01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:31.770
Jessica Zaleski: Really important for you.

581
01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:44.130
Sue: All to to be able to speak up and and and be brave enough to say, hey, if I don't like this I you know I you up should be brave enough to say, you know, that's probably not the best behavior for us, we need to change that.

582
01:28:48.630 --> 01:29:00.630
Sarah Michaels: I have a question. Yeah. What if somebody does something that hurt somebody's feelings or makes them feel afraid. How. How should we handle that.

583
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:05.130
salam: That's a great question.

584
01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:06.060
Jessica Zaleski: Fair online.

585
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.930
Or

586
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.780
Sue: Yeah, like in this class. Maybe, yeah.

587
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:18.840
I did something or said something that you, that was hurtful to you. What do you think, you know, what do you guys think, what, what should we

588
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.070
salam: Go.

589
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:31.140
salam: Oh, sorry, I don't think you should argue about it. I think you should like talk to the teacher privately like you don't like the way they like

590
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:32.550
Like

591
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:34.620
To explain

592
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:40.800
Sarah Michaels: Can anybody else put what they think salaam is trying to say.

593
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:42.600
Sarah Michaels: Out there.

594
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:51.120
salam: Oh, they don't like the way like they comment on that thing they did. Yeah, that's what I have to explain

595
01:29:53.640 --> 01:30:06.330
Jessica Zaleski: So you can, yeah, talk to the teacher maybe after let's think about again respect with big right so we're all kind of in agreement that we want to show respect to each other. And we've talked about

596
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:16.140
Jessica Zaleski: The behaviors that we we are going to avoid right we're not gonna laugh at each other. We can laugh together. But we're not going to laugh at each other, we

597
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:25.830
Jessica Zaleski: Were not going to roll our eyes. We're gonna, you know, I'm not going to talk in the chat privately or do any of that because those are signs of disrespect, but if someone says something

598
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:39.990
Jessica Zaleski: And it's you know you're upset or you feel like it's not showing you respect. Is there any other way. You think we should handle it other than waiting and you talk to the teacher after. What do you guys think

599
01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:55.560
Jessica Zaleski: So this is one time where I want to tell you, and where you're going to hear this a lot, there's no right answer here. This is just ideas like anything you say right now, you know,

600
01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:03.240
Jessica Zaleski: Um, I mean, I guess we would have to talk about like we're obviously we're not going to be violent, with one another. That is not the way to handle it, but

601
01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:12.810
Jessica Zaleski: You know i mean i don't i'm not like looking for a particular answer here when I asked you, like, what, how do you think we should handle it. There's not like a right answer, I think.

602
01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:27.000
salam: Like what you should say like if someone being disrespectful to you, like, I think you should say, Can you please be more respectful and if you want to do the like to the offer camera, not in front of me to hurt my feelings. Yeah.

603
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:29.310
Jessica Zaleski: Well,

604
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:35.790
Sue: What if, what if you saw or heard somebody one of yours, your classmates saying something.

605
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:42.540
Sue: You didn't do it yourself, but you saw somebody else doing it. What do you think we could do.

606
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.910
salam: I would say thank you to them because

607
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:54.030
Sue: I'm gonna like Christopher, can I use you as an example, haven't asked you. Can I use example.

608
01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.410
Yes. So what Christopher. What if I, what if

609
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.770
Sue: Let's say Leandro

610
01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:08.250
Sue: What if you saw Christopher laughing at something that Reggie said

611
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:12.000
Leandro Graterol: What do

612
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:15.420
You say or do, maybe

613
01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.160
Leandro Graterol: Just tell him why he's laughing or something.

614
01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:29.550
Sue: I mean it's okay to actually say maybe we shouldn't do that. Right. It's, it's, you have to be very brave to be able to do that.

615
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:32.160
Sue: You know, a peer pressure right

616
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:39.120
Sue: It's easier to go along with what everybody does, it's more brave to say that's not the right way to do this.

617
01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.620
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, somebody

618
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:43.950
Sue: Wrote, be brave, yeah. Oh really. I didn't see that.

619
01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.180
Sarah Michaels: Yes, so

620
01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:51.630
Sarah Michaels: What do you guys think about that norm of trying to be brave in this group.

621
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.560
Leandro Graterol: You brave to give your idea to the t shirt.

622
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.950
Sarah Michaels: Yeah.

623
01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:57.630
Sue: The has Leandro

624
01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:04.980
Jessica Zaleski: I love it. Like, we're talking about if you're seeing something disrespectful. But, I mean, we talked a lot in our group about how

625
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:14.400
Jessica Zaleski: Sometimes we don't want to share ideas because we're afraid of what other people will think, or we're afraid that we're not going to have the right answer.

626
01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:27.480
Jessica Zaleski: But if we all agree that we are going to be brave in this group and for our bravery. We will be rewarded with respect from everyone else. So no matter what we say.

627
01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:39.990
Jessica Zaleski: Our ideas like we're going to feel safe to say our ideas and to share our ideas because we are confident that we will be shown respect from everyone. Because we've all agreed to that.

628
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:49.860
Sarah Michaels: It would be really cool if we ended with this group with everybody feeling just a tiny bit braver.

629
01:33:50.490 --> 01:34:02.940
Sarah Michaels: In themselves, you know, with themselves and and a little bit more like a leader in a way because you could stand up for yourself or you could stand up for somebody else. I mean, that would be awesome.

630
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:15.990
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And then everybody. Yeah, everybody should have the opportunity to be heard. And it's not disrespectful to agree or disagree. It's just how you approach it. So you could

631
01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:22.740
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That person could have a great idea and say, I definitely think that's a great idea but I happen to disagree.

632
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:32.430
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And then you give what your ideas. It doesn't mean that what they said isn't right, or it's not valid. It just means that you may think a little bit differently. And that's still respectful.

633
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:46.740
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna go off of what you just said Miss beltre so it's okay if I have an idea that different from yours. Like, do you feel comfortable if I listened to your idea, respectfully, and then I say,

634
01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:55.620
Jessica Zaleski: I actually disagree because I think that. And I explained my idea, but I'm respectful to you. Is that okay, how do you feel about that in this class.

635
01:34:56.250 --> 01:35:06.270
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: In this class, I think it would make me feel comfortable because at least you gave me the opportunity to say what I thought you listen to kind of understand me, and then you thought

636
01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:19.980
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: About it and then you gave your idea on it and it's not saying that I'm right or wrong. You're just saying, I just don't happen to agree with you but you know it's a great thought and that's fine, that's fine. I feel okay with that.

637
01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:31.800
Jessica Zaleski: So we can affirm each other's ideas and say, I appreciate your idea, but I disagree. Because of this, and still be respectful with one another.

638
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:34.440
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Definitely also

639
01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:43.710
Sue: That might also provide you miss be with an opportunity to rethink what you originally thought and maybe even change your thinking.

640
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:45.630
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That happens to me.

641
01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:54.930
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: An offer something else. They say, I happen to disagree with you and then they tell me what their thoughts are. And I'm like, well, now that you say that

642
01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:07.740
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I'm going to rethink that. So it's always a great opportunity to think a little bit further on something, it's always great to hear. Everyone's ideas because you never know what it's going to make you think, or make you ponder later on.

643
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:23.520
Jessica Zaleski: Have you are you guys ever changed your mind about something, because you are having a conversation with someone and you listen to what they said. And then you were like, oh yeah, I didn't ever thought about it like that, or

644
01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:27.150
Jessica Zaleski: You know, oh that's. Has that ever happened to you guys before

645
01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:29.850
Sarah Michaels: So Edwin, Edwin said yes. You got to tell

646
01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:30.210
Sarah Michaels: Us.

647
01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.080
Leandro Graterol: When did

648
01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:32.820
Sarah Michaels: What tell us what that was like.

649
01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:35.790
Leandro Graterol: Me.

650
01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:36.900
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, Edwin

651
01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:47.580
Leandro Graterol: Gone by I was talking, he was disagree with something because I was I'm trying to say something. He was like, Oh my God, you don't need to say like that.

652
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:58.170
Leandro Graterol: He said to me, like history so bad that I feel so bad. And I told him. You don't need to spread like that. And then he told me, Well, we can talk about it and we can fix like

653
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:02.070
Leandro Graterol: A relationship, you know, okay.

654
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:03.210
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yeah, that's great.

655
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:17.010
Leandro Graterol: Yeah, I like to talk to, like, when they saw when there's a problem or something. I like to talk to that person and on know what is happening to him or something. What can I help

656
01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:19.890
Leandro Graterol: Okay, I like to help you.

657
01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:38.520
salam: Actually, something happened like last week I wasn't TV class then like girls that kids start laughing on a nother kid's name. And I was like, why would you laugh at him. It's just a name.

658
01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:47.550
salam: Like it's not it's not that big problem. And the person didn't say anything. So I felt bad for him because why would you like his name.

659
01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.400
Sue: Just the fact that you stood

660
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.560
Sarah Michaels: Up to somebody and defended.

661
01:37:52.560 --> 01:38:05.100
Sue: That person your classmate, is that, that, that's great. And that was supportive of that that classmate and I'm sure they really appreciated your, your standing up for them and defending them. Well, thank you for doing that.

662
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:06.930
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, that's being brave.

663
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.310
Jessica Zaleski: So, so I think that, you know,

664
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:22.470
Jessica Zaleski: I think that what we should do. So we're going to kind of keep this moving on, you guys have generated some great ideas. I'm not sure that we have like a full consensus on what our

665
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:30.900
Jessica Zaleski: Norms should be. But we definitely have a really good idea. So this is saying and I and Missy, and the others. Can we can kind of take a look at this and

666
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:46.710
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe pull some key ones together. And then when we start class tomorrow we'll look at these again. Okay, and just kind of say this is what we're seeing here, but it seems like respect is huge showing respect to each other. We've talked a little bit about what that looks like.

667
01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:56.490
Jessica Zaleski: And being brave okay with our ideas and and this is a time where I just want to mention that, you know, scientists

668
01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:10.140
Jessica Zaleski: We tend to think that scientists like have all the answers for everything, and they're super confident and they know exactly what they're doing, because they've gone to college and

669
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:20.850
Jessica Zaleski: They've gone to graduate school and maybe they have a PhD and they've learned so much and so when they come up with an idea in a lab or

670
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:35.520
Jessica Zaleski: You know, wherever they're working that that idea is correct and everyone's just going to tell them what a fantastic idea. They have, but the reality is that is not what science is like at all. Okay.

671
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:36.570
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Don't tell me that all the

672
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:36.900
Time.

673
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:52.170
Jessica Zaleski: Must be like, you know, and that I'm you know we can really think the cool thing about learning right now is you guys, we're all living in a time where we are seeing scientists all around the world.

674
01:39:52.560 --> 01:40:16.230
Jessica Zaleski: Struggling to understand what is happening on our planet right now with code 19 when this started scientists were desperately working to figure out exactly what this virus was doing to map it to figure out the intricacies of it and how it was transmitted and nobody had all the answers.

675
01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:29.910
Jessica Zaleski: So they had to work together and there were times where there were good ideas and there were times where there were ideas that other scientists looked at and said, oh,

676
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:42.990
Jessica Zaleski: You know, I'm going to challenge that let's think about that a little bit more. So right now we're going to share some we're in talked about this idea a little bit more, but we want to share with you some important

677
01:40:43.470 --> 01:41:01.710
Jessica Zaleski: Words that we're going to be using in this journey together that you might not have really heard elsewhere before you've heard the words, but maybe not exactly in this context. Now I'm a Nisha should I share my screen or do you want to share the vocabulary. What's easier.

678
01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:03.420
Jessica Zaleski: You can share your screen. Okay.

679
01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:15.120
Jessica Zaleski: All right, very good. I've just I'm, you know, a little zoom deficient and Mrs. He is doing that when she was talking about scientists, trying to figure out what's going on with this pandemic.

680
01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:30.540
Sue: I want you to understand that this is not just one person. This is entire teams of people willing to work together, communicate with each other and share their ideas on how to serve.

681
01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:40.860
Sue: How to solve this world's problem and that's what learning is about in a classroom is working together as a team to help the bent to benefit the whole group.

682
01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:48.630
Anisha Hassan: This is he did you get it, it's the green button and then

683
01:41:48.720 --> 01:42:01.170
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, I am. Okay, so here's my problem is I don't have the privacy setup right for it. So if I just put it in the chat. Can you share it. Yes. Okay. Very good.

684
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:07.620
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you so much. I'll change that for tomorrow.

685
01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.150
Anisha Hassan: No, that's totally okay.

686
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.000
Jessica Zaleski: That's gonna make me restart zoom and I don't want to do that right now.

687
01:42:14.850 --> 01:42:15.240
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

688
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:17.040
Anisha Hassan: guys see my screen.

689
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:21.810
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, okay. So actually that's. Oh, the group, nor know the OH.

690
01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:22.770
Jessica Zaleski: You know what I think.

691
01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.580
Jessica Zaleski: You just go over to the virtual science pod folder.

692
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:28.860
Anisha Hassan: Yeah yeah

693
01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.700
Jessica Zaleski: And then it's

694
01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.010
Jessica Zaleski: In there, I can

695
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:43.860
Jessica Zaleski: In Session one, it's the key terms. I've got it right here so I can always okay so

696
01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.450
Anisha Hassan: There it is. Session one

697
01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.290
Anisha Hassan: You terms. Yep. Okay. Got it. Perfect.

698
01:42:53.190 --> 01:42:56.310
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, oh, that's Belcher sharing. Okay.

699
01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:57.420
Anisha Hassan: Oh, thank you.

700
01:42:59.010 --> 01:43:00.120
Jessica Zaleski: All right, here we go.

701
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:10.740
Jessica Zaleski: I don't know if it needs to refresh. It's really blurry on my screen. Is it blurry. I'm

702
01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:11.700
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, it's also

703
01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:12.990
Anisha Hassan: My screen.

704
01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.150
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Let me see if I can downsize it

705
01:43:17.670 --> 01:43:19.860
Anisha Hassan: I have it on. So I came. Okay.

706
01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:21.360
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Okay.

707
01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:24.840
Anisha Hassan: You got

708
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.040
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, yeah.

709
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:26.730
Teamwork.

710
01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.520
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, awesome.

711
01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:33.690
Jessica Zaleski: So can you just go into present mode there and then

712
01:43:35.490 --> 01:43:47.220
Sue: Great. Yeah. So these are going to be some of the terms and things that you're going to hear the words that you're going to hear the vocabulary that we need to be familiar with, when we're talking to each other. So we all need to know

713
01:43:48.630 --> 01:43:52.380
Jessica Zaleski: The understanding of these so that we can actually work better together.

714
01:43:52.740 --> 01:44:03.540
Jessica Zaleski: So this is the time where we'd like you to have your notebooks out okay and your pen or pencil and we're going to write these words down in our notebook. Okay. And the examples of what they mean. So grab your notebook.

715
01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:12.870
Jessica Zaleski: Grab that pen or pencil that mistake included and it's only for four terms that we're going to talk about right now.

716
01:44:13.170 --> 01:44:28.080
Sarah Michaels: And I want to say one thing, if someone doesn't understand something, anything you got to be brave and and say, I don't understand, or what does this mean, so don't sit back and not understand. But this is a time to show brave bravery.

717
01:44:28.890 --> 01:44:42.780
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so before we go, I totally agree, Sarah. Thank you. Before we go to the first word. I am going to ask you if I say the word model. Okay model.

718
01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:54.300
Jessica Zaleski: What do you guys think of go ahead and type in the chat. What do you think of when you hear the word model. What or who or what do you think of model.

719
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:58.260
Okay, the type of car see

720
01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.100
Jessica Zaleski: Right person.

721
01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:10.410
Jessica Zaleski: Type of bike versus a role model.

722
01:45:16.770 --> 01:45:22.560
Sarah Michaels: Type of bike or type of car you mean like the model of the car. The model is it a

723
01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:26.490
Sarah Michaels: An X, whatever, is it a

724
01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.320
Sue: 150 or 250

725
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.810
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, so like Angie said like a type of something. So it could be like which model iPhone, do you have or

726
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:34.110
Sarah Michaels: Yeah.

727
01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:37.530
Jessica Zaleski: Which model bike you. Okay. All right. Very good.

728
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:57.090
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, cool. Oh, nice. That a 3D representation of a thing. Okay, a design of something. OK. Key Sean a building. Okay.

729
01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:02.070
Sarah Michaels: Well, I want to go, I want to go back to what Nikki said is it Nikki or knee.

730
01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:02.970
Jessica Zaleski: That's Nikki.

731
01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:08.670
Sarah Michaels: Nikki Yeah, say a little bit more about what you mean by a 3D representation of a thing.

732
01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:20.430
Nhi Huynh: Um, so for because in my biology class I have seen like a DNA model that's why me. Yeah.

733
01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:20.970
Yeah.

734
01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:28.260
Sarah Michaels: Or a model car, you know, a version of it, but it's not the real thing. It's a, it's a, yeah.

735
01:46:29.010 --> 01:46:30.840
Sue: smaller or bigger. Yeah.

736
01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:36.870
Jessica Zaleski: Remembering that model of the cell that we have in our classroom. This may

737
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:49.320
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, it's not a real cell, obviously, but it's a model. Alright, so the reality is, you guys are all correct. These are all different meanings of the word model in English.

738
01:46:49.800 --> 01:47:02.880
Jessica Zaleski: But we're going to talk about a way that the word model is used in this context in science that's different than the things that you guys have shared. So you're all right. You're all correct

739
01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:16.530
Jessica Zaleski: It's just this when we're talking about a model in science and we're going to share a definition with you in a second. It's going to be different than that. Okay. So if we want to go ahead to the first slide.

740
01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:18.450
Jessica Zaleski: Next slide.

741
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:25.920
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so what is a model in science. Let's see.

742
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:32.610
Jessica Zaleski: All right. What does it say, Mrs tonight. What's a model in science.

743
01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:50.340
Sue: So you you all said some of these. It's a picture. It could be a picture or an explanation or set of rules that explain how something happens. So when we look at that picture of the cell, we can see where things are set up inside that cell.

744
01:47:51.540 --> 01:48:03.930
Sue: But one thing that we didn't talk about in this statement was a set of rules that explain something so that's probably something that's going to be a little bit different in this class that we talked about that set of rules right

745
01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:16.200
Sue: Also a model can be revised, as we learn and discover new things. So even if we come up with a set of rules or a picture or an explanation of something

746
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:33.930
Sue: Let's say today. It doesn't mean that it's not going to be changed next week or next year when we learn new things about it, we always have to be open to changing or revising our model when we learn something new.

747
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:48.480
Sue: Two examples that we put here are the example of, let's say, a Flat Earth model and a spherical earth model. So before we knew what the earth as a globe actually looks like.

748
01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:58.560
Sue: People sailors used to think that if they sailed their ship across the ocean to the horizon that they would fall right off the edge of that ocean.

749
01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:07.800
Sue: And in reality that never happened because the earth is more spherical. So, I mean, I actually have my globe that I've showed you, many, many times.

750
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:26.430
Sue: Another example of revising what we know about a model is what's going on today right coven when this first happened in March, we were told to follow a certain set of protocols to stay healthy to stay safe.

751
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:35.790
Sue: Are we doing exactly the same thing that we did back in March or hasn't changed at all. Some way maybe somebody

752
01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:53.220
Jessica Zaleski: What do you guys think, are we doing anything when we first stayed home from school at the beginning of quarantine, what were some of the things that you were hearing on the news and in the media that that scientists were saying things we should and should not do.

753
01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:57.090
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, we were in lockdown.

754
01:49:57.450 --> 01:50:00.780
Jessica Zaleski: Total lockdown. Are we still in total lockdown.

755
01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:02.310
Nhi Huynh: No.

756
01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:03.510
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

757
01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:10.320
salam: And I think they said you always should have a mask on. Wherever you go, but not at home all the sleep.

758
01:50:11.130 --> 01:50:11.580
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

759
01:50:11.670 --> 01:50:14.730
Jessica Zaleski: So at first. Actually, there was a little bit of a debate.

760
01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:27.360
Jessica Zaleski: About masks. Right. At first, they said, No, you don't need an N 95 mask. You just, you know, really nobody needs masks masks aren't going to do that much. And then that changed.

761
01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:37.950
Jessica Zaleski: When they learned more about Kobe. Then it was no masks are a great way to protect yourself and others from the virus.

762
01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:40.230
Jessica Zaleski: Now here's a question.

763
01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:49.800
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Does anyone remember when we used to use Lysol just to spray in the air. What did we end up using it for once coven happen, was it just an air freshener anymore.

764
01:50:51.810 --> 01:50:53.040
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I don't think so.

765
01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:54.300
Jessica Zaleski: What did you do

766
01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:55.680
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: All those packages.

767
01:50:57.870 --> 01:50:58.830
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That changed.

768
01:50:58.890 --> 01:51:01.350
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That definitely changed. What did

769
01:51:01.590 --> 01:51:11.400
Jessica Zaleski: Did anybody when they went to the store the grocery store anything leave their groceries outside or wipe them off. Do you remember when they were telling us to like

770
01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:31.080
Jessica Zaleski: Wipe your groceries down and your bags and be careful with packages, because they thought that coven could be spread on cardboard and plastic and other surfaces. Now does anybody wipe their stuff down know why because like

771
01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:36.150
salam: Now, I think, is less is less like coven did think

772
01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:54.870
salam: But Miss I have, I have something to say, okay, so I didn't think there's call for that first. And I think this whole thing is just made up to just keep us at home and I don't know why, but I think it's just made up. It's not a virus.

773
01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:58.680
Jessica Zaleski: Do you still think that or you thought that at the beginning.

774
01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:16.500
salam: No, I still think that cuz, how is it a real fibers if is a real virus, it wouldn't be like this, like, you know, Miss how sometimes people get viruses. Yeah. And they don't have to wear masks or anything. Just don't get too close to people.

775
01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:22.620
salam: Yeah, and stay at home until like this virus goes away.

776
01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:26.220
salam: And I don't think so. Like I'm

777
01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:30.960
salam: Everyone has to take the vaccine, but it's just my opinion.

778
01:52:31.410 --> 01:52:38.610
Jessica Zaleski: That's okay. You can that's perfectly fine to share your opinion. And I think that there have been a lot of questions.

779
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:46.350
Jessica Zaleski: About coven. And I think part of the reason that that's happened salaam is kind of what we're talking about right that

780
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:56.280
Jessica Zaleski: Scientists at first, we're using the best information that they had to help protect us and inform people about what to do.

781
01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:04.530
Jessica Zaleski: And then that started to change. And some people said, Oh, okay. It's because the scientists are learning more and they're discovering more

782
01:53:04.770 --> 01:53:11.670
Jessica Zaleski: And it made other people a little skeptical, like maybe they don't really know what they're talking about. And it can we trust this

783
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:29.940
Jessica Zaleski: Because we are seeing science change very rapidly right now what site because scientists are working so hard. You know, all around the world to figure this out. And so, information is changing very very quickly on this. So people, you know,

784
01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:44.430
Sue: Salaam. I also comment on what you said, I'm an adult and I am a science teacher. I also had questions about the severity of this pandemic when it first came out.

785
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:59.400
Sue: Mostly because I didn't know anybody that actually tested positive, it was a while before I actually knew people that had that now I do personally know people that have experienced this, and had some very

786
01:54:00.450 --> 01:54:01.170
Sue: Terrible.

787
01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:07.410
salam: Reactions and experiences with this this disease. So

788
01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:10.620
Sue: I have over time changed my thinking about it.

789
01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:15.090
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And I would say the same. Go ahead, Salaam.

790
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:16.440
salam: Know you can go first.

791
01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.770
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Oh no, I always talk. I'm a teacher, you go

792
01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:38.550
salam: Tonight, so why I think is fake. Because in Jordan. Someone died so enjoy. Did someone died. The doctor said will pay you money if you if you say he died from covert like why would you say that just to put numbers.

793
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:51.390
salam: So. And the person said no, why should I do that and everyone's gonna like not talk to them and like not come close to them or visit them or anything because they're just putting numbers.

794
01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.840
salam: So that's why I think is fake.

795
01:54:55.950 --> 01:55:05.340
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And I would say for me. I guess I'm, I'm in the other end, because being a scientist. And as I said in the beginning, my background is I work in the lab.

796
01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.530
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: With viruses and bacteria.

797
01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:08.610
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So,

798
01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.410
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: When they say oh it's fake. I think of some of my research and things that I've

799
01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:21.060
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Been exposed to. But I think the tough thing about coven is because we have a lot of viruses out there. I think when you say the word virus.

800
01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:27.960
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: People think there's one thing. There's one virus. There's one bacteria. But what makes it different from other ones is the flu.

801
01:55:28.230 --> 01:55:37.980
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: We've had time to look at it and research it but coven was a tricky one because we've never been exposed to it before. It's like getting a new

802
01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:49.380
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Getting something new and you have to figure out how does it work, how do we fix it. We didn't know. So when you don't know something, it's sometimes it makes you a little bit more nervous about it.

803
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:56.700
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And I would say for me initially or in the beginning, I didn't think it was that bad. I'm like, they're just making a big deal about it.

804
01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:05.220
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: But at the time that it happened. I happen to be teaching at a school that we have an open door policy, which means a lot of people come from different countries.

805
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:20.400
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And I had maybe 25 students fleeing or leaving Brazil, because their families were dying from coven so they wanted to get as far away from it as possible. So for them, coven was more real than it was for me because I wasn't seeing it.

806
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:31.890
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So I think the tough thing that makes people not understand if it's real or not real is when it doesn't affect you sometimes you're like, Hey, no it doesn't exist. But there are some people

807
01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:47.790
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Who are definitely seeing it firsthand and I hope that no one ever has to experience it firsthand to really see how tough cove. It is. It's a tricky one. And we don't know all the answers. So we're going to keep learning new stuff about it too.

808
01:56:48.450 --> 01:56:57.210
Jessica Zaleski: And Miss be do you think it will be even 10 or 20 years from now, we'll still be discovering new things and learning new things from the data.

809
01:56:57.630 --> 01:57:10.440
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I definitely think so because now we know there's we have a vaccine for one and there's a new strain. So now we need to start learning put our think tanks back on and start learning again. Yeah, excellent.

810
01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:17.070
Jessica Zaleski: So that kind of goes to when we're talking about a model like if they're developing a model around

811
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:27.960
Jessica Zaleski: And how to effectively treat coven 19 right like rules for that. But then there is a variation of coven

812
01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:35.160
Jessica Zaleski: They do they have to change that model and like revise it a little bit to treat the new strain.

813
01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:43.710
Sue: It's like Kobe change the rules on us change the rules of the game. So we have to be a step ahead or try to figure it out.

814
01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:48.840
Jessica Zaleski: So missing. Did you read the last paragraph yet.

815
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:50.370
Sue: I did not

816
01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:53.160
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, another really important part of

817
01:57:53.580 --> 01:58:00.390
Sue: A model in science that we're going to use in this class or in this in this program is that models.

818
01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:10.050
Sue: Need to be able to be shared publicly between scientists and researchers so that others can review them test them.

819
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:29.550
Sue: Challenge them and improve them. We have to be again brave enough to be able to share our ideas with others and be able to willing to put it out there to get suggestions from others, so that we are willing to make improvements to the model that needs to be done.

820
01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:45.750
Jessica Zaleski: Let me ask you guys a question. Do you think that we would have a vaccine for coven this quickly if scientists just kept all their ideas to themselves and only worked by themselves, or with maybe one other scientist.

821
01:58:47.730 --> 01:58:48.510
Sue: A lot of no's.

822
01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:59.520
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, I mean it could take 10 1520 years visit, you know, and this is be. You can probably speak to this more. But I remember hearing

823
01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:08.160
Jessica Zaleski: Early on in this that never before in the history or certainly modern history of science have

824
01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:18.660
Jessica Zaleski: Scientists been more collaborative around the world not competing with each other, sharing information because everyone had a common goal.

825
01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:30.330
Jessica Zaleski: Figure out coven and figure out a way to treat it and vaccinated against it. So you know that that to me was so inspiring because I was like wow you know it's natural for people

826
01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:38.220
Jessica Zaleski: To want to compete, you know, in science and you want to be the first one to a discovery or something like that and you hear about that a lot.

827
01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:46.950
Jessica Zaleski: But for scientists to make progress, like this. It made me think, wow, if scientists shared information about

828
01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:58.800
Jessica Zaleski: Other research. The way they've shared information about coven. Think of the diseases that we might be able to cure and the problems that we might be able to solve around the world. Definitely.

829
01:59:59.070 --> 02:00:07.020
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: If you think you probably have done some stuff on DNA. Most recently, can you think if Watson and Crick didn't share that idea about DNA.

830
02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:13.890
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Would we know anything about it if they just stayed in their little labs with their little notebooks and kept it to themselves now.

831
02:00:14.370 --> 02:00:24.570
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: We wouldn't know about what's going on in our DNA and our genome and all that good stuff and it. This is great that they're sharing that information about coven if they kept it

832
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:38.460
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: In the country that they found it. We would never know and collaboration. That's huge. And that's what we want to do in the group work together respect each other. Collaborate share ideas so we can all grow from it. Absolutely.

833
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.860
Jessica Zaleski: Alright so model is the

834
02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:46.710
Jessica Zaleski: First word that we wanted to review with you guys the second word that we want to talk about

835
02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:58.830
Jessica Zaleski: Is phenomenon. Okay, so what is a phenomenon. We're going to talk about it for a minute. And have you write this down. And then we're going to show you some really cool.

836
02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:07.470
Jessica Zaleski: Pictures about it. But the first bullet point about what is a phenomenon, a phenomenon is something real.

837
02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:18.450
Jessica Zaleski: In the world that can be observed or seen or experienced. Okay, so we're observing it usually when we think of observations we think of

838
02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:31.290
Jessica Zaleski: Observing with our eyes, but you know that's we can experience or or see something. Okay, so here are just a few examples like we can see eclipses if the sun.

839
02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:41.130
Jessica Zaleski: Or the moon are eclipsed, and we're only seeing part of that because of the position of the sun and the earth and the moon in relationship to one another.

840
02:01:41.610 --> 02:01:50.130
Jessica Zaleski: That is a phenomenon in nature. Okay. Um, when an apple falls from a tree or any fruit files from a tree like

841
02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:57.780
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe we don't think about that too much, but that's something that needs explaining. Okay, we can observe it. Okay.

842
02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:04.140
Jessica Zaleski: goosebumps. If we go out in the cold, it's very cold outside right now if you went outside without a sweatshirt or a coat

843
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:22.080
Jessica Zaleski: In a few seconds. Your skin might change and get all goose goose bumps. Why, like, okay, that's interesting. I can see it. I experienced that. Um, if you go outside on a cold day and you exhale, and you can see your breath. Wow. Okay. That doesn't

844
02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:26.070
Jessica Zaleski: Go ahead and as I said that's a great phenomena.

845
02:02:26.370 --> 02:02:34.050
Sue: Yeah, everybody's experienced that when you go outside. You're waiting at the bus stop and you breathe and you can see your breath. Why does that happen.

846
02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:48.840
Jessica Zaleski: Well, and that leads right to the next point like this is a phenomenon is something that we have to ask why or how it happens. Like, I'm curious, you know, why is it when I go out on a cold day, a really cold day, I can see my breath.

847
02:02:49.290 --> 02:03:00.450
Jessica Zaleski: But on a hot day in the summer. I can't see my breath. Like, I'm still breathing. So how does, how is that happening. Why is it different. I don't know the answer to that.

848
02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:01.740
Jessica Zaleski: And that needs

849
02:03:01.890 --> 02:03:03.630
Jessica Zaleski: To the next. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

850
02:03:04.050 --> 02:03:10.110
Reggie: Okay, so it didn't like was calling senses the IRS code and like you read this hot music a tiny clouds and like that.

851
02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:13.380
Jessica Zaleski: You're absolutely onto something there.

852
02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:14.250
Jessica Zaleski: Right, yeah.

853
02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:20.790
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely. Okay, so a phenomenon. Also, I think. Do we have one more bullet on this.

854
02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:22.830
salam: Incident from the soul.

855
02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:26.490
Jessica Zaleski: Is there one more bullet or are we at the

856
02:03:26.490 --> 02:03:26.700
End

857
02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:36.960
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, we're at the end of it. Okay, so what we're going to do now is an issue is going to click on that word phenomenon and it's going to take us to

858
02:03:38.130 --> 02:03:43.350
Jessica Zaleski: A website where we're going to look at some phenomenon phenomenon.

859
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:44.430
Jessica Zaleski: He is the plural.

860
02:03:44.610 --> 02:03:49.890
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And great responses I see the the thinking like a scientists, you are thinking

861
02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:51.000
Jessica Zaleski: Had her baby per

862
02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:03.570
Jessica Zaleski: La alright so let's take a look. If you can scroll down a little bit. I'm a shot. And let's just take a look at these pictures. Okay, they're

863
02:04:03.630 --> 02:04:06.060
All examples of phenomena.

864
02:04:11.250 --> 02:04:15.360
Anisha Hassan: With that plant is a neat. I know that water. So water had

865
02:04:15.930 --> 02:04:16.170
Oh,

866
02:04:17.490 --> 02:04:18.840
Jessica Zaleski: So, so

867
02:04:19.050 --> 02:04:26.070
Jessica Zaleski: When you're looking at these, do you have any questions about anything you're seeing in these pictures.

868
02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:34.680
Sarah Michaels: It's a cool website because you can actually watch these these videos.

869
02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:35.580
And

870
02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:39.840
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, so here. So what look at the one with the crow.

871
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.120
Jessica Zaleski: Cool. Yeah, this is for

872
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:46.230
Sarah Michaels: The crows trying to get that little it can't get it.

873
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:49.080
Jessica Zaleski: It's a treat or something in there so

874
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:51.030
Sarah Michaels: And then he gets it. So,

875
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:58.350
Sarah Michaels: The crowd. So it starts again. The crow is is using tools, in a sense, to get to get

876
02:04:59.430 --> 02:05:01.140
Sarah Michaels: Or anyway. They're all cool

877
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:07.620
Jessica Zaleski: Here, like my question about that Sarah would be like, how does the crow know

878
02:05:07.710 --> 02:05:20.400
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, to pick up that tool and drop it in the beaker to get the tree. Like, how, how did the crow figure that out. Like, how was he able to do that right

879
02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:21.210
Sarah Michaels: So,

880
02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:26.100
Reggie: Like when he put the first one in he's seen in the water leg rise dog something he didn't again.

881
02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:32.010
Sarah Michaels: Interesting. And so he's remembering and so figuring try that again.

882
02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:52.260
Sarah Michaels: And each of them. You can ask questions about like you know that you can ask why, like, look at that. Butterfly. Why does this butterfly, you know, how has it evolved to have. I don't know. A each of them makes you ask different kinds of questions.

883
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:56.220
Sarah Michaels: Of how fly a butterfly looks like it's

884
02:05:56.310 --> 02:06:00.660
Sue: It's on top of that woman's face and it looks like her eyes.

885
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:05.820
Sarah Michaels: Right when you see that butterfly, you think, Oh, it looks like eyes on their wing well

886
02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:06.690
Sue: Why is that

887
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:07.950
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering, like,

888
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:11.790
Jessica Zaleski: Why does a butterfly need to have something that looks like eyes on it like

889
02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:14.790
salam: A model like a design.

890
02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:16.800
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, it's a design. Yeah.

891
02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:23.760
Reggie: Go ahead, isn't a scare off like preggers and stuff that was like QE

892
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:35.460
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, I could get back. I mean, again, we don't necessarily have to know the answers, but we can have lots of questions and then we could decide to let's go figure. Let's find out what we can, let's try to figure this out.

893
02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:41.010
Sarah Michaels: I got everybody something new. I didn't know you guys were going to show this site.

894
02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:53.490
Sarah Michaels: The person who developed the site is one of my best friends. He's just the coolest guy in the world. His name is TJ McKenna and he he lives in the Boston area.

895
02:06:53.970 --> 02:07:06.750
Sarah Michaels: He would love if you ever want to meet this guy, he would love to meet you and and zoom with us. Someday, so we can talk more about it later. But he's it's an the site, he just put it together himself.

896
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:16.740
Sarah Michaels: And now he has people helping but it's millions of people have have looked at this, the site. He's a really sweet cool guy. You guys would love him.

897
02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:23.100
Jessica Zaleski: So that is a great question. He said, some of the is some of this like typical

898
02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:36.450
Jessica Zaleski: physical phenomenon. And it's true. Some of this is is physical phenomenon that happen and like the difference between a phenomenon and other things is like a phenomenon.

899
02:07:37.230 --> 02:07:53.340
Jessica Zaleski: Is needs to a can't just be explained with like, you know, a very easy answer. Okay. It needs to be like a little bit deeper explain you know a deeper explanation for it. There needs to be

900
02:07:54.180 --> 02:08:07.080
Jessica Zaleski: It's kind of a multi step explanation. It's not one quick answer to it. Okay. And we might understand like looking at some of these, like, oh yeah, I've seen that before, and all

901
02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:26.310
Jessica Zaleski: Like oh those humpback bubble feeding. I've seen those humpback whales doing that and why are they doing they're doing it to eating. Yeah, but, but why do they form this circle and be this way that that's a phenomenon that's happening in nature. We can see it.

902
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:39.240
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I have a question. This like phenomena have to be something that's always big or is it something that you have to explain. Could it be something like with a yes or no answer that I can just say, yes, this can happen, or no, it can't happen.

903
02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:44.850
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I'm a little confused on that part. I know I'm the science teacher. But see, as I said, we don't know everything.

904
02:08:46.890 --> 02:08:48.900
salam: Are these experience.

905
02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:55.800
Sue: Yeah, they usually are something that you can experience something that you can see

906
02:08:56.670 --> 02:09:03.750
Sarah Michaels: They're all real. These are not fake. Nothing. Nothing made up here. Nothing Photoshop. These are all real. Yep.

907
02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:11.940
Jessica Zaleski: So to answer that kind of answers must be question, right. So, yes, we can say yes, these all happen.

908
02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:23.310
Jessica Zaleski: But really what scientists are always trying to figure out, you know, scientists can observe and see that okay, this happens. Yes, it is happening. But the real question is,

909
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:35.070
Jessica Zaleski: Why is that happening and how is it happening because those are the harder questions to answer. Okay, I can observe, I can observe that

910
02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:51.540
Jessica Zaleski: You know the guys are there or those shrimp right there and say, Oh yeah, they're doing this that is happening, but to explain why or how it's happening that takes a little bit. You have to go deeper with that to understand

911
02:09:53.070 --> 02:10:07.650
Sarah Michaels: Yes, if you can ask a question like what the heck yeah. Do you guys. I bet you guys can between now and tomorrow you'll come up with a phenomenon in your house, in your backyard. Like, what the heck. What, like

912
02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:08.760
Jessica Zaleski: Why does that happen.

913
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:27.780
Sarah Michaels: Yeah. So see if you can find anything that you can say what the heck is causing that and and bring let's bring in phenomena that we have questions about just see if you can notice a phenomenon that's worth saying what, how does that work.

914
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.700
Sue: You don't have to look it up.

915
02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:31.290
Jessica Zaleski: And find the answer. No, no, no.

916
02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:31.860
Jessica Zaleski: No, no.

917
02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:33.510
Sarah Michaels: Question is interesting.

918
02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:45.480
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe something you've always wondered about right, like, yeah, so we have just being mindful of the time we have five minutes left, so maybe we can just do one more term today before we go.

919
02:10:46.680 --> 02:11:04.860
Jessica Zaleski: So we'll finish up today with a word that we are here. You're going to hear us use that term that we're going to hear is, what is the driving question okay so copy this down. What is a driving question miss be do you want to explain this one a little bit for us.

920
02:11:06.330 --> 02:11:18.780
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: A driving question. So let's see a driving question, a question about the phenomenon that we need to answer order to better understand what is happening.

921
02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:27.330
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So let's see, sometimes when you guys are preparing for an exam, you'll hear people say, like, we're going to prompt you

922
02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:41.940
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: With a question if we're going to prompt you with your question we want to ask you something that's going to make you think about something that will help us better understand. So if I'm going to have a driving question. So let's see.

923
02:11:43.650 --> 02:11:49.440
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: What do you think would be a good exit. What would be the easy driving question, what would you think something simple.

924
02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:55.830
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I'm trying to think of the best driving question for this.

925
02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:58.200
Jessica Zaleski: Well Leandra just put one and

926
02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.550
Jessica Zaleski: Why Granger. Oh, can you unmute and ask your question.

927
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:08.880
Leandro Graterol: Awesome. Sure. Um, wasn't as a quarter of the eyes always shamed.

928
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:12.690
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so why

929
02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:27.870
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: even question it would make you think, and focus on a particular phenomenon and now you actually wonder why is it that the colors of the eyes always change. So now you want to investigate or think about it.

930
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:30.000
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Definitely

931
02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:31.920
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: A great question.

932
02:12:32.190 --> 02:12:33.240
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Do you have one. Go ahead.

933
02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:41.040
salam: How does like like these nails like our real nails grow. This is what I always wonder about

934
02:12:41.130 --> 02:12:44.610
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, back in question Salaam. That's excellent.

935
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:48.420
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That's a how and why put together. And now we want to focus

936
02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:57.270
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: On that and try to figure that out. Very good. Does anyone have any other driving questions. Remember, there's no right or wrong answers here.

937
02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:04.950
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I see the chat going. Let's see how your plane stay in the air.

938
02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:05.520
Yeah.

939
02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:08.640
Sarah Michaels: Right, yeah.

940
02:13:09.210 --> 02:13:13.680
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I wonder that all the time and I, I always say please stay in the airplane stay in the

941
02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:14.010
Air

942
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:19.740
Sue: as heavy as it is right, it's somehow stays in the air.

943
02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:28.410
Jessica Zaleski: So when we're talking about a driving question. It's really kind of that second bullet point like the driving question helps to focus

944
02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:43.290
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so we're not talking about like driving like in a car. Where's it like if I'm driven. I am focused and determined and I am going towards a goal. So the driving question helps to focus the scientist.

945
02:13:43.650 --> 02:13:57.930
Jessica Zaleski: Focus the testing and the experimentation on so they can develop the model of to help explain the phenomenon. So that's how the three kind of all work together. The driving quite you start with the phenomenon.

946
02:13:58.470 --> 02:14:14.460
Jessica Zaleski: You ask a question about it like the end row and he Sean and salaam have done and then from that driving question you're going to come up with an explanation for it. That's your model.

947
02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:19.830
Jessica Zaleski: So go ahead, go ahead for

948
02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:27.960
Sue: Your model today may not be the same model, you have a year from now when you learn some more things about it. Absolutely.

949
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:32.490
Jessica Zaleski: Remember models can be revised and changed. Yeah.

950
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:44.550
Sarah Michaels: It's like your best current explanation of a phenomenon and and it can be revised and changed as you learn more

951
02:14:46.830 --> 02:15:02.100
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And if you really want to think of a driving question. Think of in school, when you have an exam, you have the multiple choice where you can just choose A, B, or C and then you have those questions that are going to require you to actually write a paragraph. Those are the driving questions.

952
02:15:03.210 --> 02:15:07.200
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: The ones we love DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS.

953
02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:25.380
Jessica Zaleski: So it is five o'clock. You guys have done an awesome job today. We'll leave this up for a moment so that you can finish copying it and we have one more word tomorrow. We're going to start with our norms tomorrow, and then we'll finish up with this vocabulary.

954
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:32.640
Jessica Zaleski: One more word tomorrow. And then we're going to get started with our first activity tomorrow.

955
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:37.020
Jessica Zaleski: Model about a model exactly to build a model. Okay.

956
02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:44.400
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So tomorrow, you get to make some decisions, you get to agree and disagree on which norms. You think we should have in the group.

957
02:15:44.670 --> 02:15:46.620
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Is very, very important. Yeah.

958
02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:48.000
Reggie: Alright so what

959
02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:49.680
Jessica Zaleski: Time. Are we meeting tomorrow.

960
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:52.950
Jessica Zaleski: 312 12

961

Jessica Zaleski: Well, the clock tomorrow 12 o'clock.

Jessica Zaleski: Tomorrow, to have some lunch or have a late breakfast or an early lunch. Okay. And join us. Same exact link the same zoom link we use today, you're going to use tomorrow.

963
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:07.950
Reggie: Yeah, I didn't get to finish the one for

964
02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:11.760
Reggie: Phenomenon can that's okay. You know what, Reggie after tomorrow.

965
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:13.050
Jessica Zaleski: We'll make this will

Jessica Zaleski: Email this and send it to you.

967
02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:18.270
Jessica Zaleski: So you can always go and fill it in. Okay, don't worry about it.

968
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:20.850
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, get some rest tonight, guys.

Jessica Zaleski: Bye bye, Nikki.

Jessica Zaleski: I buy me. That was me. I'm sorry.

02:17:04.530 --> 02:17:05.160
Sue: It wasn't me.

Jessica Zaleski: Sorry, that wasn't that was Arnie

992
02:17:08.130 --> 02:17:09.570
Sarah Michaels: Miss these guest.

993
02:17:09.810 --> 02:17:11.340
Sue: Me other computer

994
02:17:11.850 --> 02:17:15.480
Sarah Michaels: Oh, oh, I was wondering who that

995
02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:17.550
Sarah Michaels: Okay, you know,

996
02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:19.380
Sarah Michaels: eliana goodbye.

997
02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:20.520
Jessica Zaleski: Bye Elio

998
02:17:21.690 --> 02:17:25.800
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Oh yes, I don't play around with disconnecting from sessions anymore.

999
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:27.330
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Great. All good with that.

1000
02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:31.230
Sarah Michaels: Wow, what did you think

1001
02:17:33.690 --> 02:17:38.970
Jessica Zaleski: I thought they did great. I mean I i if, like, in general, I am

1002
02:17:39.450 --> 02:17:53.490
Jessica Zaleski: I think the two that I was most concerned about based on what they said early, were you, Lee, who basically said she wasn't going to turn her camera on and I told her, like, you need to. So we really and then she didn't really participate at all.

1003
02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:04.380
Jessica Zaleski: So we really need to make a decision about that because I don't think it's fair to just allow her to not fulfill that obligation and to stay in the group.

1004
02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:05.070
Jessica Zaleski: I think

1005
02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:10.950
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Maybe give it time because I think there are. In total, there were seven students that didn't have their cameras on

1006
02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:20.430
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So I was writing those down. So she did contribute less than probably most but the other ones didn't have their cameras on but we're contributing so it's

1007
02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:30.000
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I think maybe now that she may be maybe they see that it's a safe space, maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow, we may see that they may buy in a little bit more

1008
02:18:30.390 --> 02:18:42.150
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, Nora started with her camera on and then turned it off. Um, and then LL contacted me today and said, miss. I don't feel comfortable turning on my camera and I just reiterated that you know

1009
02:18:42.930 --> 02:18:55.200
Jessica Zaleski: You know, that is one of the expectations. And I think if you try it. You'll find. I know it's strange at first, but if you try it. I think you'll find that it gets a little bit easier. And he said, Okay, you know, I'll try.

1010
02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:03.900
Sarah Michaels: So, and he did say he did contribute more and more and more. So that's interesting. It may take and you could see that.

1011
02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:17.040
Sarah Michaels: Kids were more excited to talk over time. Yeah. But so yeah i think i think we should give everyone time to grow into this but also tell them

1012
02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:34.080
Sarah Michaels: That the deal is, you gotta, you gotta so give them some, but I think you're right it doesn't seem right, that we would force people to do this and they're uncomfortable, but they're doing their best. So, but let's

1013
02:19:34.650 --> 02:19:38.370
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: You think Julie did say in the in the chat that

1014
02:19:39.390 --> 02:19:41.520
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: We're having Wi Fi issues and at one

1015
02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:44.670
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Point when we were talking about phenomenon. You lead did

1016
02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:48.030
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Give a response. And then someone cut in

1017
02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:50.040
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And Julie actually put in the chat.

1018
02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:51.660
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That Wait, I wasn't done

1019
02:19:53.460 --> 02:20:00.900
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So yeah, so it's somewhere in the chat. I wrote that down when I wrote like things not cameras, not being on best way I wasn't done

1020
02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:01.260
When

1021
02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:10.530
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I sent a message would you like to share your thoughts. Now, we would love to hear, and then I'm having Wi Fi issues came on, so

1022
02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:13.530
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I think that is definitely encouraging.

1023
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:24.510
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, yeah, no, I'm encouraged by that. I think I'm just a little like she's just a little more on my radar because she said from the gecko. I'm not gonna and and you know, again, this is where like

1024
02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:34.170
Jessica Zaleski: I'm all for giving them time. But I also know that the flip side of that is, the more we allow them to keep their cameras off the others will just start turning

1025
02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:35.430
Sue: Your cameras on dropping off.

1026
02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:46.410
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yeah, I had mentioned it. I think I sent I sent it to. I think it nice. I was like oh seven cameras went off, should we address it. But again, we're trying to get them to understand that this is a safe.

1027
02:20:46.770 --> 02:20:50.250
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: A comforting a respectful space. And I think we establish that

1028
02:20:50.550 --> 02:21:03.120
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And we talked the norms and now I think that now that tomorrow's session is going to start and we key in on what the expectations and the norms are then if you can adhere to those, then we're having kind of a different conversation. What

1029
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:14.790
Sarah Michaels: What is it during the norms discussion, even if it, it doesn't have to happen tomorrow. But what if we said, what do you think about this norm that everyone has their camera on.

1030
02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:30.270
Sarah Michaels: And see what you know the students might have strong thoughts about it and and in a sense. If we open it to being open to letting people argue

1031
02:21:30.810 --> 02:21:42.030
Sarah Michaels: For why it's important. And whether or not it should be, you know, it's part of the the rules of the club. It's part of their job. So what it, what did they think about it.

1032
02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:44.910
Sarah Michaels: And then

1033
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:57.420
Sarah Michaels: I mean i don't i don't know i i feel really strongly that this is a norm, we're trying to establish and that it will make a big difference.

1034
02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:03.960
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And salaam did mention that Cameron, she said, I can't even say it about anything about that because I keep mine off but

1035
02:22:04.650 --> 02:22:10.320
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Um, then she went into something else. But she kept her camera on the whole time. So even feeling that, like, you know,

1036
02:22:10.770 --> 02:22:23.490
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: This is a norm, but I can't say anything because I usually have mines off. I think that is an opening conversation. And I think that may possibly encourage others because she said, I'm not even going to talk about that because I know mines stays off.

1037
02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:30.060
Jessica Zaleski: I, I just don't. I just, I'm afraid. I just want to clarify with you said like

1038
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:39.540
Jessica Zaleski: I don't think that we should present this as it's up for debate, like the option, you know. That's my only concern because I think part of this too is like

1039
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:44.220
Jessica Zaleski: This isn't just an optional thing that they're doing in their own free time.

1040
02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:52.530
Jessica Zaleski: There are expectations when you like Sue was saying we were talking about this earlier. And she's like, if you go to work and you refuse to come out of the bathroom because you don't want people to see you.

1041
02:22:52.890 --> 02:23:01.230
Jessica Zaleski: You know, I mean, and this is why having this apart they are under no obligation to participate in this. We absolutely want them to. And we can give them time

1042
02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:11.550
Jessica Zaleski: But I think part of this, too, is because I noticed, like when a Nisha you started presenting a lot of cameras went off that didn't bother me at all. I THINK THIS. IT GOES LIKE TO THE CELL PHONE thing like

1043
02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:15.300
Jessica Zaleski: Because cell phones are not allowed in school at all. This is one of my pet peeves.

1044
02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:27.360
Jessica Zaleski: We never get to have conversations with them about when is it an appropriate time to have your cell phone out and when is it not an appropriate time. Because the idea is we're supposed to pretend that nobody has the cell phone.

1045
02:23:27.390 --> 02:23:29.190
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Oh, I have that conversation, day one.

1046
02:23:29.490 --> 02:23:35.820
Jessica Zaleski: Well we yeah but see at South. It's like we just collect cell phones and all that, like, because it's a constant battle but

1047
02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:49.530
Jessica Zaleski: I think that like if we can say like, okay, so the act, the norm is like after we do the discussion, Sarah, like you talked about, like, okay, so the norm is like the rule is going in where that we're going to have our cell phones on, can you

1048
02:23:50.160 --> 02:24:01.470
Jessica Zaleski: Think of a time during this room where it wouldn't be acceptable to have your camera off. Is there a time when you think you know and I do think if somebody screen sharing and they're taking notes like

1049
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:13.470
Jessica Zaleski: For me as one of the facilitators. That's an acceptable time. What if we're having a full group conversation and no one's presenting on the screen. Is that a time to have your camera off. Is that okay to have your camera off. Then

1050
02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:21.990
Jessica Zaleski: Or not like this is empowering them to discern these things and make some of these social decisions that they need to make that don't even

1051
02:24:22.050 --> 02:24:24.480
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Then maybe possibly we should establish

1052
02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:35.100
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I mean they signed the contract. Maybe they have the norms that they established for the group, but we have that one norm. So having your camera on is the norm and expectation

1053
02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:44.160
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: For this club, but then you can present the options of when it's okay not to have your camera on, but allow them to establish the norms for everything else.

1054
02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:46.050
Jessica Zaleski: I think this is our only one norm.

1055
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:58.200
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: This is what we expect. And they already said, be respectful participate. Don't laugh. So they've established everything else, but we only have one one norm, we only ask one thing and then they can establish everything else.

1056
02:24:58.350 --> 02:24:59.940
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: The whole reverse psychology thing.

1057
02:25:01.530 --> 02:25:03.450
Sarah Michaels: And then we have to stick to our guns.

1058
02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:06.390
Sarah Michaels: So we don't have to do it right. This right today.

1059
02:25:06.570 --> 02:25:16.560
Sarah Michaels: Know what we give them we discuss it. We give them the, the rules and then if they they can't do it. I think by that point, though, want to stay

1060
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:17.850
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I am so to

1061
02:25:18.270 --> 02:25:38.520
Jessica Zaleski: Go into that. Like, I think that Nora would have kept her camera on if others weren't like didn't turn them off LDL. I know that if I am very confident that if his mom KNEW HE DID NOT HAVE HIS CAMERA ON she would not be standing for that at all like we just met with her last week.

1062
02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:48.840
Jessica Zaleski: So, you know, but I i think like will let it go tomorrow. But then, Sue and I can have conversations with them again individually and just

1063
02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.380
Jessica Zaleski: One on one, you know, we'll keep Uli after and talk to her for a few minutes. We can talk to, Ellie. Ellie again and

1064
02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:02.370
Jessica Zaleski: You know, I know that las mom would I'm very confident, she would not be happy to find out he was not mom.

1065
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:12.570
Jessica Zaleski: You know, fulfilling that and I don't want to get his mom involved before, but the fact that that is their parents signed these permission slips and they knew the rules to. Yeah and there's

1066
02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:13.530
Sarah Michaels: This is the job.

1067
02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:23.400
Sarah Michaels: We. Exactly. Yeah. And that's, you know, we can be supportive and encouraging, but it's a job. I think it's a lesson they need. They need to

1068
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:26.970
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And I mean, maybe we could do the gentle reminders. I mean, like, they said.

1069
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:32.160
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: If something is not going right, or we're not doing something correct to kind of let us know by herself so

1070
02:26:32.430 --> 02:26:38.820
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: As we're doing it. If we don't happen to be the presenter. Maybe that's that time for that gentle nudge a gentle reminder

1071
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:49.050
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Don't forget to turn your camera on type thing to reinforce it. And then if they don't follow through. Then you that exacerbates that one to one, because you don't want to give them that feeling like

1072
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:50.790
Jessica Zaleski: You're in the principal's office that

1073
02:26:50.820 --> 02:27:01.140
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: type thing. So I do think that the cameras being on obviously is pivotal to this, but I mean, I don't want to be down to five students because of camp. Do you know what I mean.

1074
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:01.470
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah.

1075
02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:09.630
Jessica Zaleski: No, I really don't see I was thrilled. I mean, Angie is so shy and has never turned her camera on and she pretty much kept it on

1076
02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:11.610
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Until we were doing the presentation. Yeah.

1077
02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:12.390
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yeah, and

1078
02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:13.140
Jessica Zaleski: I mean,

1079
02:27:13.410 --> 02:27:26.730
Jessica Zaleski: Honestly, I have never seen these kids, except for Sabina, Christopher Leandro and key, Sean. That is it. We have not seen these kids, other than those four

1080
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:34.020
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So I say, taken as a stepping stone, because this is their first opportunity. And in the beginning you practically saw everyone

1081
02:27:34.170 --> 02:27:43.830
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And think to school doesn't require them, and they show their face, even if it was a flash screen. Now we need to encourage them and build up that confidence, like it's okay to be in the safe space.

1082
02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:49.650
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: With your camera on. We're not laughing We're not doing means we're not doing any of those things like you're okay here.

1083
02:27:50.250 --> 02:27:57.150
Sue: And then the next thing that I would like to focus on is to try to get them to actually unmute and speak, speak.

1084
02:27:57.810 --> 02:28:09.780
Sue: That have in the chat. I think it's great that we have so much participation in the chat, but it is hard, as you know, to be completely a part of the conversation while you're looking at the picture and

1085
02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:11.040
Jessica Zaleski: Also be involved in

1086
02:28:11.130 --> 02:28:12.810
Sue: That so yeah

1087
02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:15.330
Jessica Zaleski: How can I have to ask you, did

1088
02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:19.230
Jessica Zaleski: You get to speak Portuguese with Kaplan at all. No.

1089
02:28:19.410 --> 02:28:20.880
Jessica Zaleski: I don't know if you've noticed

1090
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:25.950
Jessica Zaleski: But when you were giving your introduction and you said I speak Portuguese her face.

1091
02:28:26.310 --> 02:28:26.670
Face.

1092
02:28:27.690 --> 02:28:35.430
Jessica Zaleski: Face like I could tell she was shocked and and we had told her that there would be, you know, a Portuguese speaker and there would be a Spanish speaker.

1093
02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:43.770
Jessica Zaleski: And I don't know if it just didn't register. But I was so happy. Like I could just tell like you know that gave her even more confidence so thank you that

1094
02:28:43.890 --> 02:28:49.440
Raquel Fernandes: Was wondering if they could presently presently chat with her, just to be sure like checking in and

1095
02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:55.140
Jessica Zaleski: Everything. Absolutely. I think that would be great. You know, I think that would be fantastic.

1096
02:28:55.350 --> 02:29:03.870
Sarah Michaels: Okay, but I think also as just a common bond at some point if you're in a breakout room tomorrow. Just say just just let some Portuguese

1097
02:29:05.010 --> 02:29:13.860
Jessica Zaleski: Portuguese please and almost feel free to speak Spanish. You know, when I need in that group. Absolutely. Like we're constantly trans languages switching

1098
02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:26.910
Jessica Zaleski: You know, all of that. It's so go for it. You know what I mean, like, they're all respectful, I, I saw lots of their faces when you, you know, introduce yourselves as multi lingual that they smile and you know so

1099
02:29:27.210 --> 02:29:33.000
Jessica Zaleski: There was water. They are so used to that. And it, it does bring a level of comfort for them. So go for

1100
02:29:33.690 --> 02:29:37.710
Anisha Hassan: Me as I follow yonder, we do with a whoo, whoo hoo. Allah says she was

1101
02:29:40.650 --> 02:29:41.580
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah.

1102
02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:50.400
Sarah Michaels: I think they're wonderful. I really think they're wonderful kind of amazed me. Who is it Salaam, who said I think cove. It is a hoax.

1103
02:29:50.820 --> 02:30:07.350
Sarah Michaels: But again, I think this notion of bravery, I think, I think the bravery thing is an interesting idea that they want. I mean, there's something really there's a really great energy I since so

1104
02:30:07.710 --> 02:30:16.440
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I just feel like, even with a for all of them. Like I this is my first time meeting them, but I just think that for some of them. It's going to take a little more time to feel comfortable

1105
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:26.190
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So it's like, I don't want to throw in the towel yet like these are like slowly build them up and I mean that's a sense of accomplishment for us. The district doesn't require them to keep their camera on.

1106
02:30:26.700 --> 02:30:39.000
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Or slowly building up their confidence, making them, be brave, maybe session one session to the cameras, not on but three, four or five. Now it's on. So, I mean, that's just, you know, a testament to the good work that's being done so.

1107
02:30:39.810 --> 02:30:46.950
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Although I would say yes, this is what it is, but I think we have to kind of build them up, but that doesn't mean five sessions and we're like, okay.

1108
02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:47.850
Jessica Zaleski: Let's kill. Yeah.

1109
02:30:49.170 --> 02:30:52.110
Jessica Zaleski: I totally agree. I just wanted to have the conversation because

1110
02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:56.070
Jessica Zaleski: Like as we keep going. I don't want to let it go, and then sudden yeah

1111
02:30:56.130 --> 02:30:59.520
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: It's session, out of sight, out of mind. And then you have seven cameras.

1112
02:30:59.580 --> 02:31:00.720
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly that gentle

1113
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:10.020
Jessica Zaleski: Guy, Chuck, it's really worth. And again, I'm not really worried about it based on what happened today. I'm not worried about it. I even think that we can get Ellen, but you leave like

1114
02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:15.420
Jessica Zaleski: Really you know Duggar heels and right from the beginning and said, I don't feel comfortable and

1115
02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:31.110
Jessica Zaleski: And so again, you know, I think we just need to work on her. And if we can get the others on what I mean she may feel more awkward being the only one without her camera on then and Julie. I got to meet her dog. She has an absolutely gorgeous Siberian Husky.

1116
02:31:31.170 --> 02:31:31.920
Jessica Zaleski: Eight love

1117
02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:33.300
Jessica Zaleski: Baby, we might

1118
02:31:33.390 --> 02:31:34.950
Sue: use that to our advantage.

1119
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:37.980
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, we see your dog. Gorgeous.

1120
02:31:38.850 --> 02:31:42.300
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Oh my word, I have a student that the dog attend class more than he does.

1121
02:31:42.570 --> 02:31:44.790
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: You know, the dogs there on time every time.

1122
02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:47.850
Jessica Zaleski: All right.

1123
02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:59.190
Sarah Michaels: And as we dig in to the content, it will get, you know, I think it will get more and then the expectation is, you have your camera on a gradually will get them and then we just say cameras on, guys.

1124
02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:10.350
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, I'm glad we've got the two days and then again. So when I can keep working with her. I mean I offered him. Maybe we can do this like she stays after because eight nights at the end of day just practice turning your camera on one

1125
02:32:10.890 --> 02:32:26.820
Jessica Zaleski: Day. That way, you know, let's just turn it on and talk I've now seen Julian person I know what you look like. I met her the other day, you know, and we can try to work through this, you know, slowly with her and build that up. And, you know, but I think we're off to a great start. Yeah.

1126
02:32:27.570 --> 02:32:39.090
Jessica Zaleski: We're going to meet tomorrow at 10 just to kind of, but honestly, I don't really see us getting much past the launch with the twins and like having an initial discussion about that and

1127
02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:44.910
Jessica Zaleski: Ideas and talking about the family history. I don't think we'll get anywhere near the manipulative part of

1128
02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:48.480
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So do you think like the first you think it would take the first hour for

1129
02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:49.860
Jessica Zaleski: The car portion and on the

1130
02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:50.670
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: second hour. Okay.

1131
02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:52.530
Jessica Zaleski: Because we're going to finish. We got to finish the

1132
02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:53.220
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Norm. Yeah.

1133
02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:57.270
Jessica Zaleski: The norms and then we get to finish the, what is a

1134
02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:00.240
Anisha Hassan: What was the last one phenomenon going public.

1135
02:33:00.270 --> 02:33:00.990
Jessica Zaleski: Going public

1136
02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:12.090
Sue: Holiday. Yeah. Yeah. I think that we should allow a little bit of time for them to share their getting to know you things and maybe practice going public with something that's comfortable for them.

1137
02:33:12.390 --> 02:33:15.390
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, I wondered about that. I just did you

1138
02:33:15.390 --> 02:33:20.970
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Think maybe sharing this sharing the screen of the slide and having them read their stuff me to

1139
02:33:21.930 --> 02:33:22.560
Sarah Michaels: Speak more

1140
02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:32.730
Jessica Zaleski: I think that's great. I actually did that like very impromptu I didn't warn my ESL class the other day we were doing women presidential and vice presidential candidates. They each did a slide and they filled it in and

1141
02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:41.910
Jessica Zaleski: Then I said, and in five minutes. You're going to share the information on their slide now. I thought they would Bach, because many of them don't speak at all.

1142
02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:50.790
Jessica Zaleski: But it was very low stakes, because all they had to do was read what was on the slide, there was no ad libbing I wasn't questioning them.

1143
02:33:51.120 --> 02:34:02.400
Jessica Zaleski: Every single kid did it so I absolutely believe with this group that they, you know, would feel comfortable doing it. But like we just got to keep in mind, realistically, to do that.

1144
02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:09.690
Jessica Zaleski: With all of them. I think it's worth the time to do it to build the community, but that could be a half an hour right there to go

1145
02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:11.850
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I mean, or you could break up the time in the break.

1146
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:15.450
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I mean it's not sharing out to the whole group, but maybe you could do it in the breakout room.

1147
02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:25.650
Sarah Michaels: No, I think it's worth it. I really do it and then their second presentation, at least for will be presenting the model car thing. So I think you won't get to the twins.

1148
02:34:25.650 --> 02:34:30.390
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Tomorrow, and I think it would just be honestly the finishing up what we did today.

1149
02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:34.170
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Slides and then and then the cars.

1150
02:34:34.410 --> 02:34:44.730
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: And I believe that will have probably established the comfort zone because it would have been all about that bringing them in. So by the time we get to the twins who knows maybe all cameras will be on the whole time.

1151
02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:47.430
Jessica Zaleski: I think that's fantastic. I really die.

1152
02:34:47.640 --> 02:35:01.530
Sue: Every year we say we probably should have spent a little more time building the culture. We know how important business is kids haven't been in this type of group. And I really think that they need to know how important it is to actually be able to have a voice.

1153
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:15.510
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That was the only thing that I was able to successfully get through an ember without being in trouble was taking that time to establish the norms. Their first three full weeks before we got into the nitty gritty and it goes a long way.

1154
02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:16.740
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yeah, it

1155
02:35:17.250 --> 02:35:17.850
Jessica Zaleski: Does it

1156
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:18.780
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Worth it does

1157
02:35:19.050 --> 02:35:25.080
Jessica Zaleski: It's so worth it to just low stakes, get them to know each other. Share commonalities, you know,

1158
02:35:25.410 --> 02:35:38.490
Jessica Zaleski: I have those conversations build those bonds and and then they get to know a little bit about you too, because you know they're interested in the other. You can tell they're interested in the other adults and I think

1159
02:35:38.610 --> 02:35:42.480
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I have a fellow Netflix lover and someone else who doesn't like smelly socks or

1160
02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:43.680
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: White shoes.

1161
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:47.130
Jessica Zaleski: Farah, you and I both put in justice, I think.

1162
02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:53.850
Jessica Zaleski: Justice that we dislike so I felt a little weird, putting it in the same category as clowns. But you know, I don't

1163
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:56.250
Sarah Michaels: I put it in the same category is cleaning the bathroom.

1164
02:35:56.340 --> 02:35:56.760
Where

1165
02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:00.930
Jessica Zaleski: Justice when you have to clean the bathroom every week.

1166
02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:02.700
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Okay, so I will not

1167
02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:04.680
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Be, where are the clowns. I will not say it.

1168
02:36:05.850 --> 02:36:07.440
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: That's how we found out my son was

1169
02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:11.460
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Afraid when he was younger. They brought in a clown. And it was like, happy birthday.

1170
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:15.870
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Parties over thanks guys for coming.

1171
02:36:18.030 --> 02:36:20.790
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so do we need to meet tomorrow at

1172
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:21.870
Sarah Michaels: 10 if you don't

1173
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:27.960
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I don't think we do because I mean we're finishing where we left off. And I think we've got the cars down

1174
02:36:28.290 --> 02:36:32.850
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yeah. Um, yeah, definitely for the meiosis I would say definitely figure out

1175
02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:35.880
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yet to Megan will schedule feel like school

1176
02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:48.120
Jessica Zaleski: The week. Exactly. Yeah. We're gonna have to schedule some planning time for the upcoming week to prep for that. But yeah, we don't have to meet tomorrow morning, I think, you know, I went through the slide deck. I think we're pretty much good to go. So

1177
02:36:48.210 --> 02:36:54.600
Anisha Hassan: One more thing. I'll just give you my number. So if when we're in the breakout rooms, you can text me if you need to get out or

1178
02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:57.060
Sue: Let me out of jail.

1179
02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:00.600
Jessica Zaleski: Actually breakout room Limbo.

1180
02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:03.420
Sarah Michaels: Everybody put their cell phone in the

1181
02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:03.840
Sue: Chat.

1182
02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:05.340
Sarah Michaels: Just so we have it. Yep.

1183
02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:05.820
Anisha Hassan: Yeah.

1184

Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: You mean my Google Voice number

1185
02:37:09.330 --> 02:37:10.410
Sue: I'm giving you my real self.

1186
02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:11.160
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, exactly.

1187
02:37:12.690 --> 02:37:26.160
Anisha Hassan: Yeah. And if you guys want to move around, because I know Justin. So you're both holes. I think you can move around, we can like play around with it tomorrow or even we can play around when we're in a meeting like this kind of meeting.

1188
02:37:26.430 --> 02:37:30.120
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: To get cuz I I realized that I wasn't a host today when I

1189
02:37:30.810 --> 02:37:33.900
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Agree when she was having issues with

1190
02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:41.520
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Her volume. I could have just put her in the waiting room popper back in and then her volume if her computer doesn't have an issue. You can restore that

1191
02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:44.580
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: But I was like, Oh, well, her

1192
02:37:46.050 --> 02:37:47.910
Sue: To raise my hand in this in this

1193
02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:51.060
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: It's in the participant box.

1194
02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:51.780
Sarah Michaels: No, I think.

1195
02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:53.160
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Isn't it are on the right.

1196
02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:54.270
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: So like

1197
02:37:54.570 --> 02:37:57.480
Sarah Michaels: Rotor reactions at the very bottom on the right.

1198
02:37:57.630 --> 02:38:01.530
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah, raise hand there it is under reaction to the chat. Is that why

1199
02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:07.860
Jessica Zaleski: Go to the bottom bar where it says share screen chat all that go to reactions.

1200
02:38:09.090 --> 02:38:18.000
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: I don't see reactions anywhere. No, so that for some people for zoom. That's an add on. But otherwise, where you open the chat. If you click participants.

1201
02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:29.160
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Underneath usually there's a bar that you can raise hand say yes, no go slower go faster. But for some of them you have to actually added on. You have to add the new zoom update or whatever.

1202
02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:32.070
Sue: All right, I'll I will do that and see if that makes a

1203
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:34.380
Sarah Michaels: Difference. Yeah, I don't have that in the

1204
02:38:34.650 --> 02:38:39.630
Sue: So maybe we want to talk to them about the importance of having a camera on. If we don't have that feature.

1205
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:40.920
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, that maybe we could do.

1206
02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:45.060
Sue: This so we could do, you know, raise up something else in case we need it.

1207
02:38:45.210 --> 02:38:58.980
Sarah Michaels: And, and, you know, we can get them used to if you agree, you can do something like that where where they don't have to rely on the chat to say I agree or yes and we can, I think, in discussions we can encourage them not to use the chat.

1208
02:38:59.370 --> 02:39:07.140
Sarah Michaels: Because they're listening so hard to everyone, but to use hand signals, if they want to speak, or if they agree or, you know,

1209
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:20.430
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: What does, it does. Is everyone able to see all of the icons in order to see if someone's doing it because some people may have two screens, where you have to go to screen to and some can see all the icons. Can everybody see all participants.

1210
02:39:21.210 --> 02:39:23.700
Sarah Michaels: I can see all participants mean right now.

1211
02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:28.620
Ms. Belcher aka Ms. B: Yeah so. Okay, so if you were presenting. Can you see everybody

1212
02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:29.910
Sarah Michaels: Well,

1213
02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:33.960
Sarah Michaels: If you're presenting if you're sharing your screen, I

1214
02:39:34.050 --> 02:39:44.220
Anisha Hassan: Don't think you can. So when you're sharing you're seeing the screen you can see it, but you'll get a notification on the bars so you can then check the notification and then see it.

1215
02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:51.720
Anisha Hassan: So that's why it's important to speak up, because you might not like the person might not like notice and

1216
02:39:51.750 --> 02:40:05.910
Sue: Our students know that because when I'm when we're presenting we tell them so many times. Now remember, when we're presenting, we cannot see the chat. You need to actually on mute and speak so they should with the reminder. They should be okay.

1217
02:40:07.350 --> 02:40:11.370
Jessica Zaleski: I'm gonna have to leave. Thank you so much. All of you. Great.

1218
02:40:11.430 --> 02:40:19.710
Jessica Zaleski: Great. I'll be in it by 1145 tomorrow and need me after you move your dresser. I'll be around. Thank you. Alright.

1219
02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:20.340
Sue: Sounds good.

1220
02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:21.540
Jessica Zaleski: All right, bye.
