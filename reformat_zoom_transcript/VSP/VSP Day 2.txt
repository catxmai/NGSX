Jessica Zaleski: Or slide rather

22
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.980

23
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.960
Anisha Hassan: Okay, because I have the ability to do that, but you just have to kind of play around

24
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.020
Anisha Hassan: Okay, yeah, see how that works.

25
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.180
Jessica Zaleski: So what did we say there were 21 of us to get total

26
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.990

32
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.260
Jessica Zaleski: You know, not that they're going to check their emails as quickly as you guys do.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.060
Anisha Hassan: Like, wow.

40
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:47.760
Jessica Zaleski: I do try. I've tried more often to just leave my phone in my bag and not which I hang by the door and then because I have an apple watch like, I'll get notifications, but then I'm not sure I can't check them like, you know, and then if it's urgent. But it is a problem.

41
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.490
Jessica Zaleski: Hi Sarah.

42
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.690

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:38.610
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, so I was about to do that, I'll do that right after this meeting because you can do that from the transcript and the video because I think because it was the first meeting yesterday.

50
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.020
Sarah Michaels: Not everybody else are to do it while you're listening and yeah

51
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.550
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, but I'm glad. Since we have the video in the transcript, it's going to be easier to do it.

52
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.110
Anisha Hassan: Everyone always so excited all the students to get in. It's very cute.

53
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.220

Jessica Zaleski: Well, this is why, like with Google meet we have. It's like quick access is turned on. So anybody can go in, but you can turn it off.

57
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.910
Jessica Zaleski: Allow people in one at a time, akin to a break. I can do a waiting room and but if the students were in the main room before I got in there.

58
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:44.460
Jessica Zaleski: I don't, I can't turn it off fast enough and then they're in there, you know, and it could be 10 minutes before and we're trying to me so you know it's funny now.

59
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.660
Anisha Hassan: They're very down here.

60
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.410

Miss and I'm waiting there were like so eager to cover was awesome.

73
00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:06.360

Sue: I thought about that and said, Yeah, that's me too. I also hate seeing other people being mean to each other.

288
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:47.340
Sue: An interesting fact about me is I am really good at fixing and repairing things I do all my repairs on my appliances at home. And why do I like science. There's always something to learn every day, even as long as I've been teaching it something do

289
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.010
Jessica Zaleski: Thanks to say

Ms. B: I always run away from pictures and cameras. So I'm putting on my brave face doing zooms and Google meets because I stay away from all things electronic that capture my image.

297
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:56.760
Ms. B: Why like science. It is the only field that lets you study absolutely everything and it's filled with so many amazing things.

298
00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.580
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you.

299
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.150

Leandro Graterol: Like it's like blank or something.

303
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.110
I wonder if

304
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.820
Sue: Are you. What is your view on the screen. Can you see all the people or can you see the

305
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:36.870
Leandro Graterol: Like when when I enter into my side like into Simon Says like different things that I put it

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:17.100
Leandro Graterol: Interesting Fact of me is I speak two languages, English and Spanish. And I want to learn Japanese. Wow. And why why I like science is because it is a subject that I helped me to know many things about the world.

311
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.360
Jessica Zaleski: Awesome, thanks Leandro

312
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.150
Jessica Zaleski: All right, Edwin be

313
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:34.920
Edwin Bermejo: Things I like is to play sports do activities and listen to music, because I don't like baseball broccoli and, you know,

314
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:46.080
Edwin Bermejo: Interesting fact about me is I like to play basketball. And the reason why I like sides because there's experiments that are cool, interesting.

315
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.870
Jessica Zaleski: Excellent sad when

316
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:56.340
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, alright. I guess I'm up so three of my favorite things are my family.

317
00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:05.280
Jessica Zaleski: Nature. I love to be out in nature spot that I love the beach. But I also love mountains. So I love nature and I know this was

318
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:19.860
Jessica Zaleski: Something that a lot of you don't like. But I love books. I love to read books and I'm in two different book clubs three things I do not like I do not like in justice. I do not like black licorice.

319
00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.460
Jessica Zaleski: And I do not like clowns.

320
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:36.480
Jessica Zaleski: Interesting fact about me. I began college as a piano performance major and I plan to go to law school, so I did not plan to be an ESL teacher, but I love what I do. I'm

321
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:36.990
Sue: Good at it.

322
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:45.450
Jessica Zaleski: Well, thank you, why I like science. I love the natural world. I'm a curious person and I love to learn new things and how things work.

323
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.730
Jessica Zaleski: All right, he Sean, you are up.

324
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.840
Three, three of your favorite things.

325
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:12.060
I like I like watching TV, playing video games, watch movies and through things you don't like.

326
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.550
Heights abandoned places clowns.

327
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:26.130
Any, any interesting facts about you. I talk a lot. Why do you like

328
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.740
It's interesting.

329
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:38.730
Jessica Zaleski: Sean, I love the abandoned places. That's really interesting because they can be kind of creepy and I'm with you on the clowns. KING JOHN. Very good.

330
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.660
Jessica Zaleski: Okay I Nisha

331
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:56.880
Anisha Hassan: I like to make. Everything's is spicy food. I really like learning history and I love anime three things I don't like is raising hot weather and what

332
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:06.420
Anisha Hassan: I everyone said cold weather but actually don't like really like hot temperatures anything about 70 is just unbearable.

333
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:18.750
Anisha Hassan: Interesting fact about me is I do not know how to ride a bike is really embarrassing. So many people have tried to teach me but I'm just so scared and I fell and it's awful.

334
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:26.880
Anisha Hassan: Why I like science. It's because it helps us to explain things around the world and how things work.

335
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:33.690
Jessica Zaleski: I have to ask you in Asia, because I know you're originally from Bangladesh. What is the average temperature in Bangladesh.

336
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:53.760
Anisha Hassan: So it's it's around like 30 degrees Celsius which is around like 80 and it's just, that's why. Like when I moved to the United States. I was like, oh my god, this is so amazing. It's not hot and humid all the time. So whenever I go back. I'm just like suffering in the hot weather.

337
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:55.740
Jessica Zaleski: Oh well.

338
00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.120
We're glad to have you in the United

339
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.240
Jessica Zaleski: I

340
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:05.910
Sarah Michaels: Think I could teach you how to ride a bike, I have a really cool technique. So maybe someday.

341
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.700
Sarah Michaels: I think I really could

342
00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.920
Anisha Hassan: Yeah. A lot of people are trying

343
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.260
Anisha Hassan: To like a one. Why don't you know like I don't

344
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.190
Jessica Zaleski: All right. Oh ma imma

345
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:30.840
Alma Martinez: Okay, so three of my favorite things are looking at videos of penguins because they're really cute. They always fall like do funny stuff.

346
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:41.250
Alma Martinez: And then just like listening to music and eating the search anything that has chocolate. I like it. And then things I don't like

347
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:54.330
Alma Martinez: When I try new recipes and they don't work out because I'm like, oh, I've done so much work and it doesn't taste good. And also, when it is no end range. At the same time, because it gets cycled Madea machine.

348
00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.630
Alma Martinez: And then like when I go to the grocery store and I forget something that I needed to buy a home on the way back.

349
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:18.990
Alma Martinez: Then an interesting fact about me is that I had three additional teeth like you know you have you're supposed to have like 30 something people. And then I had three other three teeth and we're not supposed to be there. Yeah. And then several people in my family also have that so

350
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:33.750
Alma Martinez: And then why I like science. I think that you can like explain how everything in nature and my the world where it's like, you take like something very small, like, you know, cells in biology or mortgages and chemistry and you're like,

351
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:43.650
Alma Martinez: Yeah. And then after a long, long explanation. You're like, Yes. And that's why trees are green, or that's why water boils, so that a descent, the June, things like that.

352
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:46.770
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you.

353
00:43:48.240 --> 00:44:02.370
Jessica Zaleski: I love that picture of the bank. Okay, I think that's it. But we're going to go back because I see that Nikki's joined us. So I just want to go back to her slide inches. A little more towards the beginning here.

354
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.470
See

355
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.550
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, here she is awesome.

356
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.440
Jessica Zaleski: Nikki, can you share your slide with us.

357
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:23.040
Nhi Huynh: Yeah, sure. So my name is Nikki and three of my favorite things are eating. I literally can eat everything like anything.

358
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:29.730
Nhi Huynh: My favorite food is Vietnamese food. I love photographing and traveling

359
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:41.220
Nhi Huynh: preteens I don't like are doing exercises or having to hurry and waking up early. I'm pretty sure that no one likes to wake up early.

360
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:50.700
Nhi Huynh: And he interesting fact about me is my first language is Vietnamese and originally came from Vietnam.

361
00:44:52.230 --> 00:45:04.890
Nhi Huynh: And the reason why I love science is is so fascinating to see that science can offer answers to almost all the questions that I have in life and make sense of everything around me.

362
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:15.420
Jessica Zaleski: That's great. Thank you so much for sharing. Now I know Tina's here, Tina. Do you want to just share a little bit about yourself with us.

363
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.760
Tina Chiem (she/her): Yeah, sure. Thanks for asking.

364
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.640
Jessica Zaleski: I'm going to just stop presenting here. If I can figure out how to

365
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.050
Tina Chiem (she/her): I think my slides at the bottom.

366
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.310
Jessica Zaleski: Actually, okay.

367
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.410
Jessica Zaleski: Wonderful, wonderful.

368
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.320
Jessica Zaleski: Perfect. Okay, so let me just present. Here we go.

369
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:36.330
Tina Chiem (she/her): Cool. Hi, everyone. My name is Tina, dude. My Favorite Things are chocolate hiking and enemy.

370
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:48.720
Tina Chiem (she/her): Three things I don't like. So a lot of people said winter they don't like winter, but I don't like being cold, so it doesn't matter if it's like 30 degrees or 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Like if it's cold. I don't like it.

371
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:55.980
Tina Chiem (she/her): And then waking up early and also loud incident noises because I be getting startled and I don't need that.

372
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:06.600
Tina Chiem (she/her): An interesting fact about me is that I hate sweating by love the feeling I get after exercising because you feel like you did something feel like your body is like, I don't know, energetic

373
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.460
Tina Chiem (she/her): And I like science because it's

374
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.990
Tina Chiem (she/her): All kinds of cool like

375
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:23.430
Tina Chiem (she/her): There's all these different things that you can research, no matter like what you want it to be. So, it explains a lot about the world and it helps us understand a lot. So I think it's cool.

376
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:32.100
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you, Tina and Tina. Can you just share why what your involvement with the virtual science pod is

377
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:45.510
Tina Chiem (she/her): So my involvement is a little bit less because then it would be with Sarah and Alicia repelling Alma I'm here as a support.

378
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:52.200
Tina Chiem (she/her): So, whatever. Y'all need for the time so I can be here. I'm happy to help out.

379
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:58.560
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you. I recently graduated from Clark. Right. Okay. All right.

380
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.690
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, wonderful. So thanks, everyone, for sharing.

381
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.820
With me

382
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.440
Sue: I, I see a lot of things in common.

383
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:19.200
Sue: Many of you said you like to anime, I can honestly say I've never watched an entire episode of anime, but my son loves it.

384
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:27.390
Sue: And and he's still trying to get me to understand that you read the book backwards, which I haven't quite mastered so

385
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.100
Jessica Zaleski: I did not know that. Okay.

386
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.680
Sue: Am I right, do is all anime read backwards.

387

noora: But yeah, so

388
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.000
Reggie: See, I've never read one because I hate reading, like I said,

389
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.480
noora: I tried to read. Why did not like it.

390
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:53.400
Jessica Zaleski: It's amazing to me how many of our students are into anime, like, really, it's really surprising to me. It's cool because I know almost nothing about it either. So

391
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.270
Anisha Hassan: What it means to like can I also live in

392
00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.430
Anisha Hassan: Tina loves out of it.

393
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:00.180
Tina Chiem (she/her): Yes, it's true.

Leandro Graterol: Don't want any means because like

399
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.380
Leandro Graterol: It's really scary. I don't like scary.

400
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.030
Reggie: Oh, the desk. No.

401
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.800
Reggie: Yes.

402
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:37.680
Sue: Can I ask, Where are you watching all these enemies because I'm still I'm old and I still have cable TV. So how do you normally get to

403
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.740
noora: Somewhere like legal we don't talk about that.

404
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:45.780

Jessica Zaleski: Kay just

410
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:09.270
Sarah Michaels: Wondering if we could have some experts who love anime.

411
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:17.790
Sarah Michaels: If there were some of us who just wanted to learn a little bit more if you guys would would show share with us. We can talk about that later, but

412
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:26.040
Jessica Zaleski: I'm curious to minute really is impressive. How many of them know so much about it and it is like a whole world. I know nothing about.

413
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:30.600

Sarah Michaels: Was the name of it. What's the name of the norm.

423
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.710
noora: A silent voice. It's on Netflix.

424
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.060
Sarah Michaels: Okay, I'm gonna try it.

425
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:13.560
Ms. B: I play cahoot in class. If I put on a biology cahoot everyone's. Okay, they'll, they'll all join. But if I put an anime on. It's funny how everybody just rushes to the front of the room and they want to take

426
00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.980
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we'll have to do an anime cahoot

427
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.880
Jessica Zaleski: On our

428
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:26.640
Jessica Zaleski: Fifth class fun day. What that we have now every other week, we'll definitely do an anime guy who and I didn't even know the anime. I should have known that anime.

429
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.780
Jessica Zaleski: But, you know, man. Okay, this is great.

430
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.190
Sue: Yeah, we weren't learned a lot.

431
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:49.830
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely. Okay, so if we take a look at where we're going today with the next thing we just need to. We did a lot of work on the norms yesterday, and we just want to have like kind of a final discussion on

432
00:50:50.910 --> 00:51:05.160
Jessica Zaleski: What were the norms that were most important to us. So I think what I'll do is I'm just going to open up the jam board and I'll kind of go to a new frame and we'll just put the post. It's that we really strongly agree on over there.

433
00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:06.600
Sue: group them together and

434
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.900
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah.

435
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:13.290
Sue: can comment on whether or not you think it belongs in one group or another, or if it's a little different. Okay.

436
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.170
Sarah Michaels: Okay, good. We all go to that jam board.

437
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:27.150
Jessica Zaleski: And we could, or I can share and they can say what they, you know, I'm just going to kind of pile them up and well we can talk about it might be easier than having everybody moving things around at the same

438
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.380
Jessica Zaleski: Time. Good, good.

439
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.140
Jessica Zaleski: So let me just share that

440
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.230
Jessica Zaleski: Go.

441
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.950
Jessica Zaleski: All right. Can everybody see that

442
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.230
Leandro Graterol: Yeah, okay.

443
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:57.480
Jessica Zaleski: Awesome. So I see a lot of respect. Alright, so I'm just going to kind of put all the ones that are respect. I guess I'm just going to kind of put them on top of each other. Okay, if they're respect. Respect respectful and people are talking

444
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.240
Jessica Zaleski: Don't rate on know that's be respectful.

445
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.350
Sue: On at the bottom right.

446
00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:19.860
Jessica Zaleski: Awesome. Okay, respectful. OK, now I'm going to keep this one a little separate because this says something in addition, this is like an example of what it means, what respect might look like in this group.

447
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.970
Jessica Zaleski: And asked us, this one. Okay.

448
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:30.240
Sue: Because a virtual class is a little bit different from an in person class.

449
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:38.550
Jessica Zaleski: So another thing I see a lot of is like participating. Okay so Leander should always participate share your ideas.

450
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:46.770
Jessica Zaleski: Ask if you have questions, answer the teacher participate participate

451
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.350
Sue: Leandro the bottom right says all we

452
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:55.620
Jessica Zaleski: Got to participate. He says, always participate bottom yeah participate

453
00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:11.730
Jessica Zaleski: Here's another camera one. So we'll put those together. Okay. Oh, and the Andrew said mute your microphone when someone is pitching your idea. Here's someone who said, Don't talk when someone's talking. So those kind of go together. I think

454
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.570
Jessica Zaleski: No side conversations never talk over people key Sean said

455
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:27.480
Jessica Zaleski: I'm going to put this one, speak up if you don't understand something. Do you think that goes with participate

456
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.460
Jessica Zaleski: Or

457
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.210
Jessica Zaleski: What do you think anybody have any thoughts on that.

458
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:37.140
salam: I think you see, whereas the other ones.

459
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.270
salam: Yeah, I meant I meant to say when you have to speak. Yeah, I think it should go, Jim.

460
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.470
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, OK.

461
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.880
salam: OK, yeah.

462
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.720
Okay.

463
00:53:48.990 --> 00:54:04.590
Sarah Michaels: I've played that one. Be brave could also kind of relate to all of those. You have to speak, speak up when you don't understand sometimes that can be a little bit scary. So the, be brave, it seems to me, goes with turn your camera on, be respectful and keep your camera on that kind of thing.

464
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.030
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. All right.

465
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:16.260
Sue: I mean, yeah, I mean, look at all of the people that said they don't like to speak even the adults don't like to speak in public and or like their camera on. So that's being brave.

466
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:23.220
Jessica Zaleski: Right here a bunch about not laughing at each other. Okay, don't laugh at each other laugh together not at each other.

467
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:31.890
Jessica Zaleski: Don't write me things and laugh at each other. Okay. Because don't insult each other. Okay.

468
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:40.560
Jessica Zaleski: And then we have be kind, be kind and helpful help each other, encourage each other. Be patient impolite.

469
00:54:42.540 --> 00:55:01.800
Jessica Zaleski: Be interested in people's ideas, be brave, is kind of like the umbrella right of all of them beyond time. That was kind of on its own answer. The teacher. Okay, so I'm going to put that with maybe share ideas and participate. Yeah, and participate. Yep. Okay.

470
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:18.690
Jessica Zaleski: All right. So when I look at kind of categories. I see that respect was a big one right respect people and respect people's opinions and kind of going along with that ways that we show respect.

471
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:33.810
Jessica Zaleski: Our that we share our ideas we participate, we ask questions if we have them we answer the teacher if she's asking something

472
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:40.110
Jessica Zaleski: We can also show respect by keeping our cameras on when we should

473
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:49.380
Jessica Zaleski: We can show respect for ourselves as learners by speaking up if we have a question. Because, yeah.

474
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:56.400
Sue: Because we don't usually talk about respecting ourselves. Usually we think respect. It's of someone else. But you absolutely have to have respect.

475
00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:06.840
Sue: For yourself and and understanding what you need and and being an advocate for yourself that you understand things. So you asked when you don't understand. Yeah, I like that one.

476
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:15.510
Jessica Zaleski: So another way to show respect is to be considered when people are talking right maybe mute your microphone when someone sharing. We're going to all

477
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:24.900
Jessica Zaleski: get accustomed to the mute unmute button on zoom, which is a little bit different than Google me, so where we all want to make sure we know where that button is

478
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:40.110
Jessica Zaleski: No side conversations don't talk over people and you know we talked about how it's going to happen that we talk over each other sometimes and that's okay. We can just say, Oh, I'm sorry. And then just wait for our turn.

479
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:53.610
Jessica Zaleski: This might be a great time to talk. Oh, you know what, let's let's do that right after let's make sure we share the hand raised and the reactions and all that right after this. Because that's one way.

480
00:56:53.820 --> 00:57:06.210
Jessica Zaleski: To help eliminate some of the talking over. I know that sometimes if I'm trying to share an idea and I keep jumping in and people jump into the same time. Sometimes I just give up and I say, oh,

481
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:13.800
Jessica Zaleski: That's all right. I'm not going to share my idea because it's too hard to get in there. So we want to avoid that we want to give everybody the chance

482
00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.170
Jessica Zaleski: To share their ideas.

483
00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:29.490
Jessica Zaleski: Another way to show respect is to not insult each other. Obviously not laugh at each other will laugh together but not at each other, don't make fun don't write mean things in the chat.

484
00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:44.310
Jessica Zaleski: Be kind. This is like the positive side of what to do. Be kind, be helpful encourage each other, be patient and be interested in people's ideas. So let me ask a question about that. What does it look like

485
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:54.720
Jessica Zaleski: How am I behave like if I didn't want to show that I am interested in your idea. What am I doing in a zoom call like this.

486
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.400
Edwin Bermejo: Turn on your camera.

487
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:59.550
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, turning on my camera. Awesome. What else

488
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:09.570
Sue: How would you know from looking at somebody. So we're looking at everybody's pictures right we're watching everybody in the video. How would you know somebody was interested in what you were saying.

489
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:13.350
Nhi Huynh: Oh, maybe give give them compliment

490
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.920
Reggie: See if they ask questions.

491
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:22.110
salam: They like make face reaction like

492
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.500
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, that's awesome.

493
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:38.820
Jessica Zaleski: So our body language shows if we're interested, right, if I'm, if I'm looking at my camera instead of looking down if you know if I'm smiling or having some type of facial expression.

494
00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:48.840
Jessica Zaleski: That shows you that I'm listening to what you're saying that is definitely showing interest. Now, I was the only one that said, Be on time. I think

495
00:58:49.350 --> 00:59:07.740
Jessica Zaleski: And that that's missing and I were talking about this before our meeting today how part of being respectful is being on time and sticking to the agreed upon time yeah so miss me. What are we committing to do for these sessions.

496
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:22.410
Sue: Now it seems like everybody is doing a wonderful job being on time signing in on time. And if there's any circumstances where you can't you let us know through email. So that is great. You keep doing things like that.

497
00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:29.520
Sue: What Mrs. He and I spoke about before was that we want to respect your time.

498
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:41.790
Sue: And make sure that we hold ourselves to the time that we committed to and that you committed to. So what we're going to do is we're going to set a timer. Every time we meet

499
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:50.040
Sue: For 10 minutes before the class is supposed to end or the session is supposed to end that we there. It gives us kind of a little warning to say

500
00:59:50.730 --> 01:00:06.060
Sue: You know the session will be over in 10 minutes and right at the end, we are going to be done. Okay, so I don't want you to think that it's going to go over into your personal time we thought that it was really important that we that we really stick to that time.

501
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:16.140
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, awesome. So I think that if we talk about our group norms.

502
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:26.820
Jessica Zaleski: It's really kind of this umbrella of respect right being respectful for each other and being respectful to each other.

503
01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:40.110
Jessica Zaleski: Having respect for ourselves as learners having respect for the ideas of our classmates and the time of our classmates and the feelings of our classmates.

504
01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:56.790
Jessica Zaleski: And allowing each other. If we do all those things, we will have a much easier time being brave and sharing our, our ideas which is so important in this and go ahead, miss, can you unmute missed. I

505
01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:12.090
Sue: Apologize. See, it's going to happen to everybody. One other thing I thought of when you were saying that was being a part of this community also means that if one of our one of our community members isn't really participating

506
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:33.690
Sue: As as much as they could. Maybe we want to we want to invite them to participate more and us as students are equal with with us here. We are all a team. We are not we are not teachers and students. We are all in a learning environment together. So I want you all to understand that.

507
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:46.230
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely. So if you feel like, wow, I've had the opportunity to speak and share my ideas. But, you know, Sabina hasn't had an opportunity to share her ideas.

508
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:57.900
Jessica Zaleski: You don't have to wait for me or miss may or miss be or anyone else in the group to say, Sabina, what do you think you could take the opportunity if you had a chance to share

509
01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:06.300
Jessica Zaleski: To say, So Nina Do you have, would you like to share what you're thinking, or I'd like to hear what you have to say, okay, you can do that with each other.

510
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:18.780
Jessica Zaleski: And this is a great practice for you. And I think, really, it will encourage you, because you know we all want to feel like people are interested in what we have to say so you can show interest in what

511
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.340
Jessica Zaleski: Your classmates have to say, you don't have to wait for us to ask

512
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:31.530
Jessica Zaleski: Right. Anything else we want to discuss here for the norms. I think we covered them all. Okay.

513
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:36.810
Jessica Zaleski: That's great. Okay, let's go on to

514
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:46.770
Sue: The we will probably just quickly review our norms at the beginning of our meeting will not take this long because we're gonna we're

515
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.330
Jessica Zaleski: Not at all, memorize them.

516
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.220
Sue: But just to remind it's good practice to remind everybody what we've all agreed on.

517
01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:09.570
Jessica Zaleski: So speaking about time, it is now 1248 we had one more key term that we wanted to talk about today. So I think what we'll do is we'll take our notebooks. Right now we are going to discuss that key term.

518
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:18.270
Jessica Zaleski: And then right after that, we'll take a short break and then we'll launch into our first activity. How does that sound. Mrs. Today I'm waiting. Okay.

519
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.320
Jessica Zaleski: So,

520
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:31.410
Jessica Zaleski: Because we did not address going public yesterday. Correct. No, we did not. Okay. Wonderful. So I am going to go and keep like opening my windows too big here, but I'm going to go back to sharing my screen.

521
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.810
Jessica Zaleski: And if everyone can make sure that they have their notebook, please.

522
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.940
Jessica Zaleski: Miss yeah

523
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.010
salam: You know, just turn off my camera.

524
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:49.170
Jessica Zaleski: William invading. This is a great time to talk about that. Okay.

525
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:58.350
Jessica Zaleski: So, you know, we've talked about how about the importance of having your cameras on so that we feel like we have a community.

526
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:10.470
Jessica Zaleski: And because really, when we, when you signed up for this you signed the permission slip and with your parents agreeing to turn on your cameras. Okay, that was part of the agreement, um,

527
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:21.660
Jessica Zaleski: But there are times when yeah maybe having your camera on is not as important, or maybe something's happening in the background at your house at that moment, and it's just

528
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:31.380
Jessica Zaleski: You need to turn your camera off for a minute. Okay. Like right now, if my kids or my dog came charging through the door. I might turn my camera off for a moment and a deal with whatever issues going on.

529
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:46.560
Jessica Zaleski: We all understand everybody's in their home. It's their personal space and something may come up and you need to turn your camera off momentarily. That can actually be a sign of respect, okay to you know to just briefly turn the camera off and deal with that whatever's happening.

530
01:04:47.940 --> 01:05:04.020
Jessica Zaleski: But there are other times when having your camera on may not be as important. Okay, when are some of the times where it might be okay to have your camera off. What do you think

531
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.410
Reggie: Um, you have to go like with something around the house.

532
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.210
Reggie: Right. Yep.

533
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.150
salam: I guess when you have to do something.

534
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:15.810
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah.

535
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:21.090
Sue: I mean, think about it, when you're in class. If you really had if it was an emergency, you had to go to the bathroom.

536
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:23.040
Sue: You know it happens.

537
01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:24.120
Sue: You might not be able to wait.

538
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.350
Sue: Till break. Yeah.

539
01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:34.020
Jessica Zaleski: What about what about what you said Salaam, earlier you said

540
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.930
Jessica Zaleski: When we were about to do notes. What did you ask

541
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.970
salam: To turn my camera. Oh.

542
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:45.270
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, okay. So at a time like we're about to have where I'm going to be presenting my screen.

543
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:52.080
Jessica Zaleski: And almost everybody is looking at the screen presentation at the moment we're not talking

544
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:59.040
Jessica Zaleski: With one another, face to face, that would be an okay time to turn your camera off for a few minutes. If that's what you want to do.

545
01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:07.800
Jessica Zaleski: And at the end of that time we will tell you. Okay. Cameras on and that will be the expectation that everyone will just turn their cameras back on at that time.

546
01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:15.360
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, but we're going to give you some opportunities, you know, again, if you want to leave your camera on them. No problem. But if you want to turn it off for a little bit.

547
01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:24.750
Jessica Zaleski: That will be fine. Well, it's similar to there are appropriate times to use your cell phone right and there are just times that it's not appropriate to use your cell phone.

548
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:30.300
Jessica Zaleski: You know, whether that's in school or, you know, even at home, you know, I'm gonna

549
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:38.640
Jessica Zaleski: I'm going to guess that at one time in your lives. You have been on your phone and your parents or guardians have been trying to talk to you.

550
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:46.410
Jessica Zaleski: And they said, Put your cell phone down, listen to me. Okay, put your cell phone. Is that ever happened to anyone. I've said that to my kids a few times.

551
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.150
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah. So yeah.

552
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:56.880
Sue: Our rule in the family was at dinner when we sit down to eat together because we want to have personal conversations with each other. Yeah.

553
01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:01.830
Jessica Zaleski: I totally yeah every, every family has different rules about that so

554
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:13.380
Jessica Zaleski: We, you know, this would be a time for these next few moments while we're finishing this slide, if you want to turn your camera off. That is fine. And we'll let you know when it's time to turn the cameras back on.

555
01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:20.880
Jessica Zaleski: So I'm going to share my screen again now everyone should have their notebook and a pen or pencil, we

556
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.540
Jessica Zaleski: Never see

557
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:33.330
Sue: Yes, sorry to interrupt you. I just wanted to make let you know and everyone else at speeds having a hard time with her her computer. It keeps kind of going in and out and frozen. So she texted me let me know that she's having some

558
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:59.280
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, Miss. Miss Belcher. Yeah. Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks for letting us know. Alright, so our final term that we're going to talk a lot about is going public. So what does going public mean when we say we want to encourage you to go public or it's important for scientists to go public.

559
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:26.130
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. In science, in order to make progress with ideas and theories, you have to share your ideas with others so that they can critique argue challenge and revise your ideas. So you can copy this down in order to make progress. This is really the key part. The important part

560
01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:40.470
Sue: Now can somebody tell me if if we have this. I remember reading this, but I've looked at the slides so many times. I'm not sure if I read it yesterday. Does it, does anybody have this written down in a notebook already

561
01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:44.130
Nhi Huynh: Know. Okay. All right. No.

562
01:08:46.890 --> 01:09:03.480
Sarah Michaels: I guess I'm curious. Could somebody put that idea into their own words what what do you think, how would you sort of say, not just read the ideas, but how would you put that into your own ideas in your own words. Well, I had Salaam.

563
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:10.470
salam: I think it means to like um you know how scientists pray like know stuff.

564
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:17.880
salam: Is like I think it means to not keep like your ideas to yourself is nice to share, like with other scientists

565
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:35.520
Jessica Zaleski: That's awesome at Salaam, and I would say to. It's not just nice to share your ideas with other scientists is critical. It is so important. And we talked a little bit about this yesterday how like with

566
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:53.280
Jessica Zaleski: If the scientists in Asia and Africa and Europe and kept in South America all kept their ideas about treatments for Corbett and vaccines to themselves.

567
01:09:54.870 --> 01:10:02.790
Jessica Zaleski: What would happen. You know, you know, this would not be a good thing that you know they needed to share their ideas with

568
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:15.720
Jessica Zaleski: Scientists in the United States and the sciences in the United States needed to share their ideas with scientists around the world and those ideas were challenged critiqued

569
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:27.060
Jessica Zaleski: Revised and together they work. They kept working forward. They change a model they made progress they tested it. They moved forward.

570
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:40.320
Jessica Zaleski: That's how important. That's why it's important to go public and not to keep your ideas Risa. You never know what it will mean when you share an idea how it could inspire someone else.

571
01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:59.340
Sue: Even if that idea is not something that holds holds true in the end, it may help somebody to step forward and come up with something else to get to the end result and everything that you say is important, so please don't be afraid to share

572
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:15.600
Sarah Michaels: Um, so, so somebody wrote in the chat discuss your findings, which is a part of what this is all about. So first of all, what what is, what is your name.

573
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:19.260
Sarah Michaels: It says beccles family. Oh, that's

574
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.670
Jessica Zaleski: That's key. Sean

575
01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:36.660
Sarah Michaels: That's key. Sean okay so Kesha on that. That's cool. So, discuss your findings. Can you just say a tiny bit more about why it would be so important to discuss your findings. I mean, that's such a great a cool idea.

576
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:41.130
Sarah Michaels: Can you just say a tiny bit more about that.

577
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:51.030
Leandro Graterol: He's typing the show's

578
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:51.900
Okay.

579
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.840
Jessica Zaleski: I can't see the chat right now just see. Yeah.

580
01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:11.820
Sarah Michaels: When, when it comes out great. Or, can anybody add on, or same more about what you think you, Sean means by just what does going public mean discuss your findings and why that would be important.

581
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:14.640
salam: Ideas.

582
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:24.300
noora: I guess like say your feelings are like your findings in public like out loud so others can hear and like see and also discuss

583
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.170
Sarah Michaels: Oh, Christopher just added

584
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:28.980
Don't

585
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.200
Jessica Zaleski: Don't try to gain keep what you discover, oh

586
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.900
Sue: I've never heard that what what gatekeeper.

587
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.550
Sarah Michaels: Can you say more Christopher

588
01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:44.010
Sarah Michaels: Tell us more.

589
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:56.640
Sue: Oh, keep it to yourself. Okay. Right. I mean, I think about all the scientists with covert and the vaccine if they had all kept this to themselves, we would not have the vaccine for the treatment right now so

590
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:59.460
Awesome. Thanks.

591
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:07.770
Jessica Zaleski: So this same idea. You know, we keep talking about scientists around the world who are doing science as their careers.

592
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:17.220
Jessica Zaleski: But this applies in this class as well because when you come into this group, you're a scientist. Okay. And your ideas.

593
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:30.360
Jessica Zaleski: Are valued and we've agreed that we're going to be respectful of everyone's ideas and we are going to be brave and share our ideas and it is okay.

594
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:46.680
Jessica Zaleski: When we go public with our ideas for people to question us in a respectful way to challenge that idea within it not, it's not a personal challenge to me. Okay. If I come up with an idea and Miss ne says

595
01:13:47.880 --> 01:14:07.680
Jessica Zaleski: That's interesting. Have you thought about this or how would this work. I'm not going to be offended by that I can say, oh, okay. Maybe she will help me to take my idea further by doing that or she's going to combine one of her ideas with mine. And we're going to go further together.

596
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:11.700
Sue: I mean, I could add to something that Mrs. He was saying and say,

597
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:23.160
Sue: Oh, that's interesting that that is those are your findings, but this is what I found, which is opposite of what you have, let's work together and see why that happened. Absolutely.

598
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:32.220
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so I think this is this is it on this slide. So we should have all of our vocabulary done and it is

599
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:51.480
Jessica Zaleski: Right now, so why don't we take a break and at 105 we'll come back and we'll get started on our first activity. Make sure you have your car that came in your science kit. We're going to get started on that you're a little model car and your notebook and pen. Okay, so

600
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:58.380
Jessica Zaleski: It's one o'clock now 105 will come back. Go take a break, get a drink, go to the bathroom, whatever you need to do. Okay.

601
01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.940
Jessica Zaleski: We'll see you in five minutes.

602
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.400
Miss. Yes.

603
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:06.900
Edwin Bermejo: Let me come back and you go back to the second one for the notes.

604
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:14.370
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, sure. And you know what I can do is I'll put a link to this in the chat right now. Edwin and then you can look at the slides. Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

605
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.420
Sue: Must be. It looks like you got your camera to work again huh

606
01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:29.430
Reggie: This thing, right.

607
01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.850
Sue: Yes. Everybody has a different car. Yeah.

608
01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:33.810
Oh,

609
01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.290
Reggie: I see us like

610
01:15:47.910 --> 01:16:02.310
Ms. B: It looks like it's working. Okay, now, but who knows right yeah they're doing road construction around here. So once they start built. Yeah, I didn't anticipate that I would have probably went to a different location if that was going to be the case, but I woke up and there was

611
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.470
Sue: Well, you know, if you lose your we know why.

612
01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.320
Ms. B: Well, I have two screens on so hopefully

613
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:15.000
Sue: And I usually do the same thing, usually my phone on and one was getting kicked off at the beginning of Google, you know,

614
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:24.780
Ms. B: Google me, oh yes, that's a hard time. Yeah. So this one's facing the road construction. This one's facing the opposite way. So hopefully they cross cancel each other.

615
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.390
Sue: Is it cold today.

616
01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:36.570
Sue: Anybody doesn't know if anybody's been outside but

617
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.350
Be cold week

618
01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:49.410
Was it. I'm trying to figure out who was it

619
01:16:51.240 --> 01:17:00.720
Sue: Is it that said she hated the cold will be no Tina, was it Tina. I feel like I'm playing a matching game, you know, from what we all did the presentations, figure out

620
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:01.800
Which

621
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.880
Reggie: I think, I think the Catholic people said they hated on the winter. All right. Hey, the code.

622
01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:11.220
Sue: Or various parts of it right ready I

623
01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:16.020
Sue: Hate the cold or you hate when it rains in that slushy dirty snow that

624
01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:20.310
Reggie: Was called counting. I think the trash during the winter can be

625
01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:30.120
Anisha Hassan: Like the cold. I feel like it's a cold lead to my coach cozy up and where a lot of blogs that is fine for the most part.

626
01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.030
Reggie: But they get sick easily though that

627
01:17:33.150 --> 01:17:41.280
Anisha Hassan: Also, yeah. I also don't like taking out the trash money. Once I went out and I got locked out like

628
01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:45.720
Anisha Hassan: I had to call my roommates and be like, let me is

629
01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:49.830
Sue: And you probably weren't wearing exactly what

630
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:57.180
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, I know. I was very like so, like, I've only going off for a minute. I don't need to make a lot of club.

631
01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:00.990
Anisha Hassan: But I just wore a t shirt and I went out that bad division.

632
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:04.590
Anisha Hassan: Sarah you're muted.

633
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:29.010
Sarah Michaels: Sorry, I'm Chris says he loves the cold and he doesn't get cold and it is really interesting. Like I run cold I get cold I run cold and my husband runs really hot. And so I'm always saying, you know, please. Let's turn the heat up and he's going up.

634
01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:30.660
Sarah Michaels: Because the warmer close I

635
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:41.640
Reggie: Know, because I was younger. Like, I'll go stuff maybe like maybe a mini or something. The next day of her coat. It's not like that. The word that's one of the reasons why you say to

636
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:57.300
Sue: Any changes to Reggie, as you get older, sometimes your body experiences temperature differently. My husband, for instance, he's actually on a heart medication that causes his heart rate to be lower, which means he gets colder faster.

637
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.610
Sarah Michaels: Interesting.

638
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:05.100
Anisha Hassan: Christopher's like he can be insured outside that is very impressive.

639
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:20.790
Sarah Michaels: Why it's so it's really different bodies. It's very interesting. And I wonder, Kris is Kris, the one who can press can, yeah. So I wonder if that if those things go together at all.

640
01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:25.590
Sarah Michaels: Like, does your dad also not mine. The cold.

641
01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:33.390
Sarah Michaels: Does it have to do with how much muscle you have or how I don't know He loves it. Yeah.

642
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:39.870
Anisha Hassan: All right, that's easy. Get all the awful is giving him installation and

643
01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.470
Sarah Michaels: Maybe skinny people generally have a harder time. I don't know.

644
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:49.410
Reggie: The only times I wouldn't like actually being the code is if I'm really sort of

645
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:52.140
Reggie: Like maybe like ice.

646
01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:54.360
Reggie: cream, ice.

647
01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:12.360
Sarah Michaels: You know, that's a phenomenon that that that Chris can be outside and shorts in the cold and other people just really can't be, I mean that's something we could say what the heck is going

648
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:22.680
Anisha Hassan: To Angie ROAD I'VE like she have a friend who is cold and summer and hard winter. That's also very interesting

649
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:24.210
Yeah.

650
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:31.170
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, and also need gets cold, even in summer like that is also very just see

651
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.070
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, all of these things make you wonder, I wonder

652
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:44.940
Sue: I wonder why that happens. Is there something. Is it something about the situation. Is it something about that person's body the way their body reacts to things. So these are all questions that

653
01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:45.270
Sarah Michaels: They

654
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.880
Sarah Michaels: Asked again. Yeah, exactly.

655
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:52.440
Anisha Hassan: Tina, you're also viewed LISA You also get cool

656
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.020
Anisha Hassan: So maybe

657
01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:01.950
Sarah Michaels: One passive. That's when you know it's the beginning of a model and it could have to be revised.

658
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:05.670
Sarah Michaels: If you come from a certain part of the world.

659
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:13.350
Sarah Michaels: Your blood is, you know, thinner or who knows what. And so you have whatever

660
01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:21.030
Tina Chiem (she/her): Scientists, I want to exercise a lot. I don't get cold easily

661
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:25.920
Tina Chiem (she/her): Y'all know from my fact that I don't like exercising or sweating.

662
01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:30.210
Tina Chiem (she/her): Maybe it's a solution from

663
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.650
Jessica Zaleski: So it is one. Oh, it's 106

664
01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:49.050
Jessica Zaleski: Actually, so if everyone can regroup. If you're back at your computer's now's the time to turn your cameras on please. And we're going to be moving on.

665
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:54.960
Jessica Zaleski: To our first activity. I'm going to open this up.

666
01:21:55.590 --> 01:22:00.960
Sue: I know it may have seemed like a long time to get to this, but whenever you start a new group.

667
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:11.160
Sue: That you always have to have time to get to know each other so that you feel comfortable actually sharing with each other. And I think we've done a really good job getting to know each other. We have a lot in common.

668
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:17.520
Jessica Zaleski: I really loved doing this slide going through the slides today and just hearing because you just never know what

669
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.090
Jessica Zaleski: You know about other people.

670
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:34.080
Sue: Until you always think a lot of times, kids will think adults are so much different than they are. But really if you heard everybody speaking, even the adults have things in common with the students. So we were kids wants to

671
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.670
Jessica Zaleski: I know maybe a long time ago, but it's true. Okay, so let me share my screen here.

672
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.860
And

673
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:54.060
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so what we would like you to do now is to take out the model car that was in your science kit.

674
01:22:55.020 --> 01:23:03.720
Jessica Zaleski: And we'd like you to just spend a few minutes, exploring the car. Okay. Just observe it.

675
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:18.660
Jessica Zaleski: Lay with it, but please do not alter it in any way. Don't take it apart. Don't try to crack it open or remove anything from it just play with it and observe it. We're going to give you three minutes to do that.

676
01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:24.450
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. Three minutes to play with it and observe that I think we forgot to do that. You talked about the

677
01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:30.960
Sue: The hand signals because I don't think in in, zoom, we have that option of a hand, if we have a question. Is that right,

678
01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:38.160
Jessica Zaleski: Well, we do in the reactions, but I'm now I'm questioning if everybody has access to the reactions. Last class we found out we

679
01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:47.370
Anisha Hassan: Don't all have that everyone should be able to when they click on the participants tab, they should be able to raise their hands.

680
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:51.210
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, customers, raising his hand right now so he knows how to do it. Awesome.

681
01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:53.490
Jessica Zaleski: Tina knows how to do it to do with them.

682
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.480
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, if people can raise their hand and raise them. That would be awesome.

683
01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.240
Jessica Zaleski: So, yes.

684
01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.110
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Yep. Okay. I'll make sure it works.

685
01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:08.880
Jessica Zaleski: Yep, it worked great. That's wonderful. I don't see it as an option when Sam and

686
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.290
I should

687
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:13.980
Sue: I clicked on participants.

688
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.510
But I do not see

689
01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:26.010
Anisha Hassan: Christopher, could you like tell us how you did it because I feel like my computer is different because I have to go through reactions.

690
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:33.960
Right issues.

691
01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:39.480
Names. It's like

692
01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:41.760
A bit of

693
01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:46.590
A list of names and that was lower hand. Yes. Or I mean these hand.

694
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.660
Sarah Michaels: Oh, yeah.

695
01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:54.240
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Yeah, you got it.

696
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:59.850
Sue: I found the like and the thumbs up or thumbs down and the clapping. Is that what you mean.

697
01:25:03.210 --> 01:25:03.570
Sue: What do you

698
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.320
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Find that

699
01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:08.670
Sarah Michaels: So where did you find that

700
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:18.810
Sue: So I found it. If I click on participants, which is at the bottom right click on that the black bar then it opens up as a sidebar on the right.

701
01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:29.190
Sue: Yeah, and then you have a little checkmark that in the middle, it says a green checkmark circle. Yes. No. And then all the way over the right there's a little circle with three dots in it.

702
01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:35.040
Sue: And I clicked on that and I have the options of a thumbs up or thumbs down a clap.

703
01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:38.670
Sue: coffee cup and a clock.

704
01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:39.750
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: I'm pretty sure

705
01:25:44.130 --> 01:25:50.520
Ms. B: Yeah, cuz she's usually their hands raised. It is a Jay says right next to the IDs that you see on the left hand side.

706
01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:57.210
Ms. B: Oh I maybe it's just not populating and then that's usually the three dots that say more, sometimes you can find it there too.

707
01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:03.690
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, we're clapping hands together for raising your hand and try that. Let's see, can you

708
01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:06.540
Sue: Can you guys tell them, clapping my hands right now. No.

709
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:10.500
Sue: I am in the chat, but not in the video.

710
01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:22.740
Sue: So yeah, I just want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity in a way for us to know that they want to speak. And if we don't all have that in the video that we might need to come up with hand signals to do that.

711
01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:34.650
Sue: So if you don't have that option electronically to put your hand up. Maybe we want to. That's another reason why it might be important to have our video up because if I do this.

712
01:26:35.010 --> 01:26:48.780
Sue: And I raise my hand. That means I'm raising my hand. It means I want to speak. Yeah. Okay, so you might need to do that. OK. So the reason I did that was because I want to make sure that before we play with our cars. We don't break them.

713
01:26:50.430 --> 01:27:00.720
Sue: Now these are those pullback cars that when you put them on the table. I'm gonna hold this up like this when you put them on a table, you can pull it backwards and then it should

714
01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:15.540
Sue: Kind of roll on its own. But if you pull it back too far. You might break it. So start off by pulling it back a little bit and then pulling it back more each time. That's the only suggestion that I have for you. All right.

715
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:19.620
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. So do we want to like restart that again.

716
01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.750
Jessica Zaleski: I think so, yeah. Okay. Alright so let

717
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:27.780
Jessica Zaleski: Me that. No, that's okay. That's okay. So we're just going to go back to that we're going to do another three minutes here. Let's

718
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:34.200
Jessica Zaleski: Examine the cars in front of us play around with them. Just don't break it. Don't take it apart.

719
01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.380
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Yeah. Mine's a

720
01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:52.320
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Slow

721
01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:00.420
Sarah Michaels: We're on a floor or table.

722
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:03.600
Sue: Yeah, it works better on a flat surface.

723
01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.310
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Okay, yeah.

724
01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:17.910
Sue: So those are things that you want to actually make note of Christopher is is when it's doing different things.

725
01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:23.820
Jessica Zaleski: And while yeah that on the next slide. We're going to actually start writing down some things were just looking at it right now.

726
01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.860
Anisha Hassan: It's not working.

727
01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:04.530
Sarah Michaels: You if you press it down and pull it back. Is it work.

728
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:20.340
Reggie: You press down

729
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:28.320
Sue: And then when you pick it up.

730
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.470
Sarah Michaels: Under who could go the farthest it

731
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.850
Sue: Will be really fun in the classroom or in the hall.

732
01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:43.110
Sue: Leander. Did you get it to work yet.

733
01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.060
Sue: No.

734
01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:49.080
Reggie: I so he wants to raise me up to have the fastest car here.

735
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:53.430
Sue: So Leandro

736
01:29:54.300 --> 01:30:03.870
Sue: Can you if you put your finger on the car and you push down on it and you push it backwards you slide it backwards and then you lift it up in the air to the wheel, move them.

737
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:07.980
Sue: So put your put your finger on the car.

738
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.930
Sue: Push down and pull it backwards. Slide it backwards and then lift it up.

739
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.600
Leandro Graterol: Right away.

740
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:21.810
Sue: The wheels move when you do that.

741
01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:23.550
Leandro Graterol: I don't know.

742
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.550
Leandro Graterol: I didn't use it like what

743
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.320
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

744
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:32.250
Sarah Michaels: For a second,

745
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.040
Sarah Michaels: Hold it up.

746
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.520
Sarah Michaels: And, you know, there's a front and a back right

747
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.630
Sarah Michaels: So with the back wheels. If you do they

748
01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:51.690
Sarah Michaels: Don't mind, nothing happens. If I go this way. But if I go this way.

749
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.500
Jessica Zaleski: I have to pull it backwards and then it'll go forward.

750
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.270
Sarah Michaels: Try the other wheels.

751
01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.730
Jessica Zaleski: I run it I my wheels spin like that.

752
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:04.230
Sarah Michaels: All right.

753
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.550
Sarah Michaels: We'll have to figure out what's

754
01:31:05.610 --> 01:31:07.050
Sarah Michaels: Going on with yours, it's different.

755
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:13.170
Jessica Zaleski: Gotta be okay. All right. Let's talk. Let's go on to the next slide. So what we want to do now is

756
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:27.330
Jessica Zaleski: Now we want as you're playing with it. Write down what you notice in your notebook. Okay so Leandra yours might be a little bit different, but you're still noticing things about the car. Okay, so anything you observe

757
01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:39.900
Jessica Zaleski: About the car, how the wheels spin. Okay, you want to write down what you're noticing your observations. Okay, just in your notebook, what you see with your car.

758
01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.790
Jessica Zaleski: And after you've written down.

Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

762
01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:05.640
Jessica Zaleski: What do you want to figure out about your car. What is puzzling or interesting to you about this car.

763
01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:16.590
Sue: This might be a good time, or when we, when we get together Leandra for you to talk with your group about the differences between your car and somebody else you might have a lot of

764
01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:17.790
Questioning

765
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:38.430
Jessica Zaleski: We'll just spend a few minutes writing down what we notice about our cars.

766
01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.810
Jessica Zaleski: What we're wondering about our cars.

767
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:46.230

768
01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:31.140

Sue: So key, Sean, you might have to sign out and sign back in. Isn't that what worked for one of the other students.

793
01:36:31.530 --> 01:36:36.600

Sue: One of my favorite shows

799
01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:13.350
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

800
01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:19.800
Sarah Michaels: Is it true that some have three pairs of wheels and others have to

801
01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:22.710
Sue: Maybe

802
01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.200
Sue: Hold up your car. We can look at them.

Sarah Michaels: So I

809
01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:51.390
Sarah Michaels: Have a question about this, the ones that have six wheels and do the back the back to wheels work the same way, or do is only the very far back.

810
01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:59.010
Reggie: Um, so there's two in the back. So the one like in front. I'm definitely one that like actually does anything

811
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:03.630
Sarah Michaels: Who, who is that who said that

812
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:04.740
Jessica Zaleski: That was Reggie, right.

813
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.100
Yeah.

814
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:09.630
Sarah Michaels: Can you show us put it right close to the camera.

Jessica Zaleski: Oh, there we go.

816
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:15.900
Reggie: So these ones right here. The one was actually doing anything.

817
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.440
Sarah Michaels: Interesting to back ones are just like the front ones.

818
01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:23.250
Yeah.

819
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:25.830
Reggie: You can just remove them.

820
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:31.890
Jessica Zaleski: Needed. You want to share something you noticed or a question you have

821
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:45.060
Nhi Huynh: Yeah. So I noticed that the life I poon I pulled the car backward does lower the car will run. And the more I pulled the car backward, the faster the color. Right. Okay. Thank you.

822
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:49.740
Jessica Zaleski: I noticed that too about my Salaam, did you want to share

823
01:38:51.600 --> 01:39:01.380
salam: Yeah, so, um, I have a question. How right we can relate to the back in, it works. But how does it work like

824
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:11.370
Jessica Zaleski: You. So that's your question, right, that's one of the questions you have. Does anybody else have a similar question like, how does this car actually move

825
01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:20.970
Jessica Zaleski: Right, I saw some people, how does the car works have been asked and Linda said, how does the car when you push it back. Go forward by itself.

826
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:35.250
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so some people, you know, have some ideas about it. But if we go back to our slides here. You know, we talked yesterday about driving questions.

827
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:50.430
Jessica Zaleski: That in science are going to help us to address or respond to a phenomenon. So we have this phenomenon right of these cars and when we pull them backward

828
01:39:51.810 --> 01:40:01.650
Jessica Zaleski: And we let go. They go forward. But the question really that a lot of you want to know, and I want to know too is like

829
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:16.950
Jessica Zaleski: How does the car actually move like what is making the car move by itself. I mean, I can push it forward. And I understand how that's happening. But if I pull it back and let go. How does the car move

830
01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:30.450
Sue: One other thing to add on that it was I think it was Christopher was trying to help Leandro get his car to work. He said that maybe if you push down on it that might also have something to do with whether it

831
01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:31.170
Leandro Graterol: Nice right

832
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:33.030
Okay.

833
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:47.430
Jessica Zaleski: So what we're going to do now is we are going to start to develop an initial model for this. And remember a model is a set of rules or explanations.

834
01:40:47.850 --> 01:41:00.240
Jessica Zaleski: About a phenomenon. Okay, so to develop our model here on. We want you to write down your ideas about how the car works. What do you think is happening so

835
01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:00.660
alias.

836
01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:03.840
Jessica Zaleski: Is in the chat you just wrote, doesn't it.

837
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.460
Sue: Have a disk with teeth that rotates. So this is one of your ideas.

838
01:41:08.610 --> 01:41:09.360
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, that's awesome.

839
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.620
Sue: You're starting to put together what you think is responsible for the movement in this car.

840
01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:25.650
Jessica Zaleski: So we're going to do this individually. We're going to spend about five minutes. Okay, just you are going to write down

841
01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:36.570
Jessica Zaleski: What you think is happening in your notebook Al's already got an idea and then we want you to include a diagram or a drawing. What do you think it looks like

842
01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:55.860
Jessica Zaleski: On the inside of this car, like what is, what are the insides with happening, what does it look like. So write down your ideas in words and also include a drawing of what you think is happening inside the car.

843
01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:59.910
Sue: And it does not have to be a perfect drawing

844
01:42:00.630 --> 01:42:06.420
Sue: The start of your ideas. So you could draw a top view of what you think it looks like inside

845
01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.100
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: A side view, whatever you want.

846
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.230
Sue: Your thoughts.

847
01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:21.810
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so I'm going to just set my timer for five minutes. Okay, this is the type just write down all your ideas about how the car works have a drawing, maybe you want to do a

848
01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:34.980
Jessica Zaleski: Drawing and kind of have your ideas coming off it however you want to do it is perfectly fine. There's not a right or wrong way for this and there are no wrong answers. Okay, these are just ideas.

849
01:42:56.130 --> 01:43:01.200
Ms. B: And definitely make sure that you're jotting down those ideas that you're putting in the chat as you're creating your model.

850
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:22.530
Sue: I can hear people testing, they can take more notes.

851
01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:31.170
Jessica Zaleski: They talked about how we're not looking for a perfect drying here it's, you know, you might have. These are just some examples that other students who have done this activity have come up with

852
01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:48.120
Jessica Zaleski: This isn't you know an art project. Okay, just getting ideas down. Okay, what we might think we just want you to keep going. It's not about being right or wrong. It's about coming up with ideas and and

853
01:44:48.180 --> 01:45:02.940
Sue: Even as you're drawing your ideas, looking at your original drawing you might change your mind and say, No, I think it's this don't don't scribble it out because we want to look at where you've started and how you revise your own models to

854
01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:05.550
Sue: So it's important to look back at what you had in the beginning.

855
01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.980
This is where I really miss actually seeing the students in class playing with them and

856
01:45:50.730 --> 01:45:54.600
Jessica Zaleski: we ever get back in person. We will do the magic to. Yeah.

857
01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.360
Leandro Graterol: I don't draw that prideful.

858
01:45:59.190 --> 01:45:59.880
Leandro Graterol: I'm trying

859
01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:02.490
Jessica Zaleski: Leandro. Don't worry about it.

860
01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:09.270
Jessica Zaleski: Look at these. Okay. It's not about great works of art here. It's just about getting ideas that's

861
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.290
Jessica Zaleski: All we care about.

862
01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:12.450
Leandro Graterol: News. That's bad. And then my drop

863
01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.250
Jessica Zaleski: Now, well, trust me Leandro

864
01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:28.290
Jessica Zaleski: You have not had the opportunity to be in class with me where I have tried to draw something on the board misty is laughing hysterically because she knows when I draw something on the board. It is really bad. Don't worry about it.

865
01:46:28.530 --> 01:46:31.410
Sue: No, I'm not. I'm laughing at mind even worse.

866
01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.100
No.

867
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:38.100
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Yes, yes, Christopher. He put the drawings

868
01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:45.810
Jessica Zaleski: You're going to keep them for a moment. We've got about 30 seconds left. So just finish getting down your ideas. Okay, and

869
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:58.860
Jessica Zaleski: That was my 32nd warning finish getting your ideas down any other like fine tuning. You want to do to your drawing. We're going to build off of each other's ideas.

870
01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:18.780
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so this is where we are going to have the opportunity to

871
01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:29.250
Jessica Zaleski: go public with our ideas because science is collaborative and we really want to figure this out together. So let's see what ideas. Other people came out with

872
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:34.680
Jessica Zaleski: We're going to be going into you will be going into one of four breakout rooms.

873
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:45.180
Jessica Zaleski: And either Miss be mistake myself or Sarah and some of the undergraduate be some of the research assistants will be in the rooms as well. Okay.

874
01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:53.790
Jessica Zaleski: And we just want to be mindful of our norms. Okay, so let's think about the norms of respect.

875
01:47:54.780 --> 01:48:08.490
Jessica Zaleski: being brave okay participating. Those are all things that you said you valued. We're going to adhere to those and keep to those norms. When we go into our breakout rooms and we're going to share our drawings

876
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:29.040
Jessica Zaleski: And share our ideas and we are going to try to come combine our ideas into one model to present. So, this is this is gonna. This is going to push you a little bit. Okay. You're going to share your ideas, see where the ideas are similar, see where the ideas are different.

877
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:38.520
Jessica Zaleski: You have to be flexible and willing to listen to each other and we were, we are going to ask one student in each group.

878
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:52.080
Jessica Zaleski: To volunteer to do the collaborative model the collaborative drawing. Okay, so they're going to listen. They're going to sketch it out. You're going to have to hold up your drawings to the camera and show everyone

879
01:48:52.530 --> 01:48:57.810
Jessica Zaleski: And we're going to have to work together in that way. MySpace, you want to add anything before we go into breakout rooms. Yeah.

880
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:10.140
Sue: So just remember that if you are going to be the one that's presenting for your group, this is, this is not just your group during it is everybody's work. So you're presenting the work of your whole group.

881
01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:13.530
Jessica Zaleski: Need you have a question.

882
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:23.670
Jessica Zaleski: No, okay. She just has her hand up stuff. I just didn't know that was a it's

883
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:30.030
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so I think we're ready to go into breakout rooms.

884
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.230
Tina Chiem (she/her): So just, I think.

885
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:39.360
Tina Chiem (she/her): I think a Nisha was supposed to be setting up the breakout rooms. Oh, yes.

886
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:42.180
Tina Chiem (she/her): She said her Internet was bad. So

887
01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.830
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, sorry about that.

888
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:45.180
Anisha Hassan: No. Yeah.

889
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:47.760
Anisha Hassan: Sorry, I'll put you in breakout room.

890
01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:48.840
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, no.

891
01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:49.140
No.

892
01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:53.460
Anisha Hassan: Sorry, I just got created them. Then my internet went away.

893
01:49:54.990 --> 01:50:09.840
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: So remember that when we move to our groups to encourage everybody in the group to share. So ask people in your group if they have any other ideas or what did you think was responsible for this and we then that can be added to your group model.

894
01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:16.890
Jessica Zaleski: And what we're going to have our cameras on when we go into our breakout rooms to because we want to show ourselves and show our drawings

895
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:25.860
Anisha Hassan: See all of us have internet

896
01:50:27.570 --> 01:50:28.680
Anisha Hassan: Okay, you know, it's

897
01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:40.740
Sue: Just take this chance if I mean if you still want to kind of tweak your designs and ideas just take this opportunity to add some things to your notes.

898
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:41.250
Yeah.

899
01:50:46.110 --> 01:50:46.680
Leandro Graterol: And don't do

900
01:50:49.230 --> 01:50:49.830
Leandro Graterol: Who said that

901
01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:55.530
Sarah Michaels: Who said that, say it again.

902
01:50:57.330 --> 01:50:59.520
Jessica Zaleski: I think it was Leandra Leandra. What did you say

903
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:01.620
Leandro Graterol: That I'm still drawing

904
01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:08.910
Jessica Zaleski: On Yeah, you've got a little two minute extra minutes here to just keep going with your ideas. I'm actually still confused. So

905
01:51:09.570 --> 01:51:10.020
Sarah Michaels: I'm going to

906
01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:11.580
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, I am too. I'm married.

907
01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:12.660
Sarah Michaels: Some help

908
01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:17.340
I truly have some new questions.

909
01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:24.300
Sue: And I'm usually pretty good. This I yeah I've never really kind of looked at it in this depth.

910
01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:37.260
Anisha Hassan: I'm so sorry everyone

911
01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:38.460
Jessica Zaleski: No, that's okay.

912
01:51:38.490 --> 01:51:42.270
Sarah Michaels: Your time. We're still we're still trying to

913
01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:54.420
Jessica Zaleski: And I promise I will play around with how to set up breakout rooms and zoom as well. So I can help more with this. This is the maybe you and I can play around

914
01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:56.220
Sue: Together. When we do our

915
01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:05.280
Jessica Zaleski: On Wednesday night, maybe play around when there's a group, teach me too, because I want to be. I want to be an equal participant and in this too.

916
01:52:06.090 --> 01:52:12.300
Sue: I don't wanna. I don't want to use the excuse that I'm no good at hosting and things to not do it. I need to learn to do it.

917
01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:16.260
Anisha Hassan: Okay, yeah, I'm opening the rooms now.

918
01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:16.680
Okay.

919
01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:20.550
Sarah Michaels: Thank you, long, how long will we be in them.

920
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:28.140
Jessica Zaleski: Um I is 15 minutes too long. Is that good. Yeah. Okay, let's say 15 minutes. Okay.

921
01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:00.810
yulie: I'll see if

922
01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:03.240
yulie: The best represent

923
01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.180
Tina Chiem (she/her): So just be successful in visiting all the

924
01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:37.020
Jessica Zaleski: Room. I did. I figured out I figured it out. It was awesome. So, um. Now the one thing I want to do is

925
01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.750
Jessica Zaleski: Well, you know what all the leaders know who was in their breakout room right so we just want to

926
01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:44.100
Anisha Hassan: Get down.

927
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:46.620
Jessica Zaleski: An issue because we'll have to set them up that

928
01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:55.530
Jessica Zaleski: Way on Friday. So you guys, I have to say I got to peek into every room and it was super exciting. What was going on in the rooms. This was awesome.

929
01:54:56.610 --> 01:55:01.770
Jessica Zaleski: I think maybe we're still missing a few people. I don't know if anybody still out there and breakout room land but

930
01:55:02.730 --> 01:55:15.480
Jessica Zaleski: We, it is 158 you guys did an awesome job today. We just want to say to hold on to your notebooks and your cars. Okay. Obviously we don't have time to share our group ideas today.

931
01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:31.410
Jessica Zaleski: But we're going to share them on Friday next Friday when we meet together again. Does anybody have any questions about how things are going about meetings and any about the meetings when we're meeting again, anything like that before we say goodbye.

932
01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:35.730
Reggie: waste the time to the same like every single long weaker.

933
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:42.240
Jessica Zaleski: You got it. So it'll be Friday three to five next Friday and then Saturday 12 to two

934
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.370
Sue: Young girl. Can you tell me, did you get your car to work at all.

935
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.060
Jessica Zaleski: No event.

936
01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:52.830
Sue: I'm going to deliver another one to you.

937
01:55:52.860 --> 01:56:00.180
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. All right. I was gonna say, I can get. I can deliver to him to Casa my police car is really he are moving right along here.

938
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:04.440
Jessica Zaleski: We get to another one Leandra

939
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:05.430
Okay.

940
01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:07.350
Jessica Zaleski: All right.

941
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.980
Sarah Michaels: Well,

942
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:11.040
Sarah Michaels: Really cool. I hope you guys and other groups.

943
01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.590
Sue: I can't wait to see the other groups.

944
01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:14.400
Sarah Michaels: I know

945
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:25.260
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. So just hold on to those notebooks. Hold on. You might even want to just take a picture, you know, of your drawing. That's always a good idea, just in case.

946
01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:36.480
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, take a picture on your phone, maybe, and you guys did a great job. It's 2pm so we're going to say goodbye, enjoy the rest of your weekend and we'll see you next week.

947
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:38.880
Jessica Zaleski: Great work. Hi, everyone.

948
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:40.200
Again,

949
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:43.830
Ms. B: Today,

950
01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.010
salam: Have a great day.

Anisha Hassan: You were successful.

952
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:06.330
Anisha Hassan: Gonna press create rooms. I was kicked out. And I'm like, this is awesome.

953
01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.910
Jessica Zaleski: And I did get your text until you already BACK IN AND WORKING ON IT WITH MY PHONE DINGS. I'm like, Oh, no.

954
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:20.340
Anisha Hassan: Yeah, because so I had to set out like Reggie with Sue and then. But I, I feel like I feel like everyone's comfortable mouth.

955
01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:22.980
Jessica Zaleski: Have to tidy Reggie was hysterical.

956
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:23.880
Jessica Zaleski: I said in the

957
01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:30.960
Jessica Zaleski: In the room. I said, Reggie, I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity like when I'm talking with you. I said, I feel like I'm a guest on your podcast. He goes, oh yes.

958
01:57:31.230 --> 01:57:32.430
Jessica Zaleski: On today's podcast.

959
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:34.890
Sue: Kinetic energy, Tony.

960
01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:35.460
Jessica Zaleski: I like

961
01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.500
Jessica Zaleski: Though, like, yeah, it was awesome. Did you, how did you get to talk to. Katelyn at all.

962
01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:55.770
Raquel Fernandes: I did in the beginning of the meeting. I sent her private message saying that like I always hear if she wants anything if she needs anything and in the break room. She asked me to translate that was great.

963
01:57:56.190 --> 01:57:56.760
Jessica Zaleski: That is

964
01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:03.600
Ms. B: Awesome. She and she said it out loud. She said, Would you mind if I have recalled translate for me and my language.

965
01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:06.300
Sarah Michaels: Some advocacy law that

966
01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:11.070
Sarah Michaels: That worked. Also with with our group, who was it who

967
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:12.870
Jessica Zaleski: Was at Leandro yeah

968
01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:25.110
Sarah Michaels: Leandro and man. He just had this whole huge idea set of ideas, our group was interesting because some people started out with gears and some people started out with.

969
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:41.460
Sarah Michaels: A spring or band or whatever. And then they ll who had been completely quiet his drawing was incredible. Amazing. And he incorporate and then he incorporated both and so everyone. It was really

970
01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.020
Jessica Zaleski: Any turn this camera on.

971
01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:46.830
Sarah Michaels: And on he was totally yeah

972
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:58.410
Anisha Hassan: That was numerous drawing was really nice. I feel like she put it up because mine was so bad. Nobody could understand it, so she was like, yeah, this is it. I'm like, yeah.

973
01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:00.900
Anisha Hassan: He was just really she's

974
01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:09.270
Sue: She wanted it to be perfect and she put a lot of work into it. It took her a while longer to get it done so that she was willing to share, we're like oh my gosh oh

975
01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:20.250
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah. How did it go asking for, like, a volunteer to be kind of the facilitator did. Did anybody volunteer in your group, how did that go

976
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:31.980
Ms. B: Well for ours. I will say play devil's advocate. I volunteered Raquel. She said, I don't have a car so I wasn't able to do it. So I said, well, since you don't have a car would you like to

977
01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:37.350
Ms. B: Be our demonstrator and she's like, okay, fine. And then salaam was going through her presentation.

978
01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:48.450
Ms. B: And she was adding different things from what she heard and they said Salaam, would you mind being our presenter since you've been adding different things from each person's model. And she said,

979
01:59:49.080 --> 02:00:02.580
Ms. B: Okay, and then we checked with everyone else and Julie said yes, that's fine, and Catherine said yes, that's fine. And she said, she'll share it out and she wants to modify it and revise it and make it better and I said in don't crack it. She said, Okay.

980
02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.270
Sue: Nisha kind of fell into that role in ours.

981
02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:06.810
Ms. B: too because

982
02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:17.580
Sue: He did not have a car, but I think that we could probably convince Christopher and Nora both to present together because they had both of them had really good ideas that they wanted to

983
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.470
Anisha Hassan: Share give you the Edwin

984
02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:28.140
Anisha Hassan: He also had really good at ease. I think what Sue said was, each person to say something about the car when you present. Yeah.

985
02:00:28.590 --> 02:00:38.700
Jessica Zaleski: That's kind of how in my group, I just said, would you be willing to kind of bring these ideas together in a drawing, and there was a little bit of like looking at each other. I had me Nikki and

986
02:00:39.210 --> 02:00:41.940
Jessica Zaleski: Reggie and Tina and

987
02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:57.090
Jessica Zaleski: Then Nikki kind of said, I will. And I said when we go to share, you can all like share something about it, talk about it. But if we could put these ideas together in a drink my they worked extremely well together very respectful.

988
02:00:57.390 --> 02:01:11.580
Jessica Zaleski: Building off of each other's ideas, bringing it back around, you know, so I felt like it was a really strong start to that this type of thinking this type of inquiry and discussion. So

989
02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:18.570
Sue: That was anybody seeing any issues with microphone or videos in we were having problems with some microphones.

990
02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:34.410
Ms. B: I know there were some that were saying that they don't feel comfortable, keeping the camera on. But as we were doing the session, you probably saw my eyes averting a couple times because I was having a continual dialogue with Nora Angie Catlin Elio Uli about the cameras.

991
02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:45.810
Ms. B: And then giving them positive feedback like with Nora. I said, while your hair is beautiful. I would love to see it. I wish mines would grow that long. And then she put her camera on.

992
02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:58.770
Ms. B: And Angie. I said, Oh, I'm freezing over here. I wish I could borrow your hat and it was just kind of back and forth. And then they were slowly coming on and then alien put his on but it was like on off on

993
02:01:59.970 --> 02:02:16.200
Ms. B: I'm like he's playing and Kathleen said, I'm really shy but I'm trying to get better about turning it on. So that was great. And you, Lee said, my hair is a hot mess. So I will, I will turn it on, because we have to have the camera on, but you'll see a black screen, but I'll show you my model.

994
02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:31.110
Ms. B: So it was just like a black screen, but it was turned on. But when it came to show the model like her face was out of it and she turned the light on and she brought the model over and the thing. And she said, Tomorrow I'll try to do my hair.

995
02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:32.760
Ms. B: But she's like, I wasn't ready

996
02:02:32.910 --> 02:02:38.370
Sarah Michaels: So she would. This is interesting. I noticed this, she actually has her camera on.

997
02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:48.510
Sarah Michaels: Yes, use the rule, but she has the room so dark. So it doesn't, you know, nothing can be seen, which is actually interesting. I mean,

998
02:02:52.140 --> 02:03:00.060
Sarah Michaels: Is interesting I texted her at some point or private messaged her and I asked her, she could turn your camera on and then she turned that blue thing on

999
02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:03.210
Ms. B: Yeah, and she kept she kept

1000
02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:13.290
Ms. B: She kept it on and she said, my hair is she says that my hair is a mess. I have a big head and I just need to do my hair but she's like, I'm going to do better tomorrow, but I will participate

1001
02:03:13.770 --> 02:03:15.120
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, no.

1002
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:25.770
Jessica Zaleski: I think, I think, you know, at least if she'll have it on and then the focus needs to be she needs to unmute you know what I mean and speak because you know it.

1003
02:03:26.850 --> 02:03:27.210
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah.

1004
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:30.420
Ms. B: She definitely did unmute in the in the breakout room.

1005
02:03:30.450 --> 02:03:31.110
Jessica Zaleski: Up, though she

1006
02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:32.520
Ms. B: She did. She did.

1007
02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:34.140
Ms. B: She did the chat and she

1008
02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:35.700
Ms. B: Did definitely unmute

1009
02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:38.430
Sue: There's some progress. That's great.

1010
02:03:39.450 --> 02:03:42.930
Sarah Michaels: We had just the best. I mean just great.

1011
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:50.640
Sarah Michaels: Group, they all showed their faces, they all talked, is that right Alma

1012
02:03:52.560 --> 02:04:01.110
Sarah Michaels: Will accept LDL until he had to show his and then he was totally there and he was willing to he said he would be willing to present for the group.

1013
02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:06.690
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, I had it on in the main room before we went in, because all of a sudden I looked, I was

1014
02:04:06.690 --> 02:04:07.110
Sarah Michaels: Looking at

1015
02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:08.730
Jessica Zaleski: And I'm like, there he is.

1016
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:09.360
Jessica Zaleski: He's got. Okay.

1017
02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah.

1018
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.350
Jessica Zaleski: We have

1019
02:04:10.650 --> 02:04:21.390
Ms. B: Four conversations for that. And he's like, okay, I was like, we just want you to be. We just want to see you. We want you to be included and then you saw it was really far back.

1020
02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:25.500
Ms. B: They were had me dying.

1021
02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:26.520
They just had me dying.

1022
02:04:27.690 --> 02:04:35.880
Ms. B: They're very clever very clever. I think our students are very hesitant to argue with each other to really to to

1023
02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:43.650
Sue: Add to the diagrams and kind of collaborate into one. Yeah, they really hesitant to do that, at least the ones that were in my group.

1024
02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.440
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, I

1025
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:47.400
Ms. B: didn't argue

1026
02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:58.080
Ms. B: They would just say that, oh, now, now I think after you said something I want to change something on mine, which was good. So they're modifying revising, but I don't think they had any counters for anything.

1027
02:04:58.590 --> 02:05:11.700
Jessica Zaleski: Like, I found myself having to kind of model that questioning for them, you know, they would present and I would kind of affirm that idea and then say, Okay, this is what I'm hearing you say.

1028
02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:20.790
Jessica Zaleski: What about that. What do you think, and then how did those two. So just because I, you know, they were all very polite and very respectful and I wanted them to see that like

1029
02:05:21.210 --> 02:05:40.830
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, I'm going to, you know, I can respectfully and politely ask you questions about it. See how that connected you agree with you know this other person. So yeah, I think if we are modeling that initially don't they're going to catch on, you know, for them. Yeah.

1030
02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:46.290
Sarah Michaels: Right, and I think, you know, down the road, we can say okay so if somebody has an idea.

1031
02:05:47.070 --> 02:05:53.430
Sarah Michaels: It'd be great if somebody could say I agree with so and so, because I disagree with so and so or I have something to add on.

1032
02:05:53.820 --> 02:06:07.110
Sarah Michaels: Or I have something else to say. And then I think they'll start once they can get their head around, I agree with because or I disagree. I think it will because they are agreeing

1033
02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:21.090
Sarah Michaels: And disagreeing. We saw that in in our group, but I don't think they ever said I disagree. I mean, he did get to this point of like is there a band a spring or not and

1034
02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:32.340
Sarah Michaels: Yeah. And, and so, but there again. I mean this is just D to they were so in the whole group there was so much

1035
02:06:37.170 --> 02:06:51.930
Sue: Jennifer slide that shows all those sentence starters that maybe we want to start with to to just give them something to say I agree with and the name, the person or I agree with. But, you know, in addition, you just so they can give them a little bit of something. Yeah.

1036
02:06:53.580 --> 02:07:12.660
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. And I'm thinking, when we start when we get into meiosis. And we're creating the babies and talking about like how we make that that's a great time for them to be agreeing or disagreeing, you know, as we're building that visually.

1037
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:25.290
Jessica Zaleski: That'll be, you know, I think they'll be in good shape for that. But, um, it is interesting that we are now, like, what, two hours behind where we anticipated being potentially you know

1038
02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:38.700
Jessica Zaleski: Well, I mean, yeah, yeah. About two hours behind, but that's okay. I think all the time was valuable, um, you know, it took us about a half an hour to do the slides. But I think that was worth it.

1039
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:42.690
Jessica Zaleski: You know absolutely worth it. I wanted the kids to

1040
02:07:42.690 --> 02:07:53.910
Sue: Know that they were important enough to spend that time I wanted to to really understand them. And I think it really did help them to know that they have things in common with each other and us.

1041
02:07:54.300 --> 02:08:01.200
Jessica Zaleski: And I think maybe if we incorporate a little like even after the break.

1042
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:10.980
Jessica Zaleski: You know, a one or two minute little icebreaker we played in geometry, the other day, would you rather. So I've got a whole slide deck of. Would you rather

1043
02:08:11.190 --> 02:08:16.140
Jessica Zaleski: And they're hysterical and just doing something quick like that where they even vote in the chat.

1044
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:28.740
Jessica Zaleski: Option one, or option to whatever it is, and they're laughing and you know it just loosens up loosens people up. So, you know, we could always do something like that. Just throw one of those and right you know

1045
02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:42.570
Jessica Zaleski: At the beginning and then halfway through. After the break, just to get people back in, you know, we could probably do even like two or three of them. And just to me. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. They're quick they're quick, but it is interesting.

1046
02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:43.560
Ms. B: Anime trivia.

1047
02:08:43.890 --> 02:08:44.070
Yeah.

1048
02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:59.190
Sarah Michaels: That was, that was interesting and I thought that was worth it because you know they know more than some of us do. And I thought that was really how excited they got they. I mean, they just were

1049
02:08:59.490 --> 02:09:02.670
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, Nora completely came alive in that conversation.

1050
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:03.840
Absolutely.

1051
02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:15.420
Sue: What was okay. Sarah I have. I tried to write down what she was trying to tell me to look at is the sound of voice a sound of voice, is that what she said.

1052
02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:17.790
Tina Chiem (she/her): Or the movies a silent voice.

1053
02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:19.350
Sue: Voice

1054
02:09:19.410 --> 02:09:20.820
Sue: Okay, because I want to actually watch it.

1055
02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:22.200
Sarah Michaels: Just I do too. I do.

1056
02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:24.780
Sarah Michaels: I'm gonna watch

1057
02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:25.980
Jessica Zaleski: You know,

1058
02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:28.050
Jessica Zaleski: How we could watch that Tina, is it

1059
02:09:28.230 --> 02:09:29.250
Sarah Michaels: It's on Netflix.

1060
02:09:29.250 --> 02:09:29.490
Because

1061
02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:33.900
Sarah Michaels: That's what, that's what I'm

1062
02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:36.870
Sarah Michaels: And what's the kid's name, who

1063
02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:41.580
Sarah Michaels: He talks. He's great. He has a slight stutter.

1064
02:09:42.210 --> 02:09:42.600
Jessica Zaleski: He shot.

1065
02:09:42.630 --> 02:09:59.970
Sarah Michaels: D, Sean. Sean Yeah, he, he was he was coming through. And that was really it was really mean that group worked really, I don't know. We did Sabina feel super comfortable, she was the only girl, but she was also

1066
02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:05.940
Sarah Michaels: You know, and she said, I don't know. I said, Is there a Springer isn't there. I don't know.

1067
02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:14.040
Sue: One of our students. I actually noticed in in his model that if he looked at in the hole.

1068
02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:14.790
Sarah Michaels: Oh,

1069
02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:17.010
Sue: He's something moving and none of us could

1070
02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:24.780
Sue: So he moved the wheels back and he looked inside and actually thought in like any held it up to the to the camera for us.

1071
02:10:26.130 --> 02:10:43.530
Sarah Michaels: I think we should get the kids. It's interesting to photograph their models and send them to you. So we could actually see because some of the drawings were just you know they're they're interesting and then there's Elio and he was just like

1072
02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:45.270
Sarah Michaels: Yeah.

1073
02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:55.800
Ms. B: I mean, it would be nice if we could get the pictures and maybe when they do show them out, whoever's group, it is you could put it on the screen because you could barely see it.

1074
02:10:56.010 --> 02:10:59.910
Ms. B: When they're putting it in the camera. So if we were able to maybe get a

1075
02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:01.680
Ms. B: Completion of those what

1076
02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:05.550
Jessica Zaleski: We talked about that. I was going to have them take a picture and put it in a slide deck, so that I could

1077
02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:06.630
Ms. B: Oh, okay.

1078
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:08.040
Sarah Michaels: That's awesome.

1079
02:11:08.070 --> 02:11:13.800
Jessica Zaleski: I think that's the way we'll start on Friday, go back, we're going to go back to those groups for a few minutes, I'm going to ask

1080
02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:26.550
Jessica Zaleski: You know, everybody to take a picture and send me the picture you can text it to me. You can email it to me. Whatever, I'll put it into the slide deck and or we can just have a slide deck and they just inserted directly into this

1081
02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:33.240
Jessica Zaleski: Group 1234 that might be easier. You know what I mean, you know, did you have something you want to say.

1082
02:11:34.050 --> 02:11:36.210
Tina Chiem (she/her): Oh, I just wanted to ask what a slide deck was

1083
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:40.830
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, it's Google Slides instead of a PowerPoint. That's what Google calls it is this

1084
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:45.300
Ms. B: Like Google calls it slides, all these fancy, fancy cars a target. Yeah.

1085
02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:55.980
Sarah Michaels: We can all be in the same slide deck and and they can actually write in, they can you know work in it. That's how everybody that's what you did when you did your

1086
02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:03.240
Sarah Michaels: That was cool. Yeah, this is very. It's very cool.

1087
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:14.250
Jessica Zaleski: Well, Jeff, it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that we're behind because every time we did some thought that, what did we do. I mean, Amber is synonymous with

1088
02:12:14.370 --> 02:12:19.410
Ms. B: It's not a quick yeah I did it for very short period of time, and it wasn't a quick process.

1089
02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.360
Ms. B: We were in Monday and ourselves.

1090
02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:36.660
Ms. B: The end result is extraordinary. But you are going to work for that. Yeah, it's one day, I can't wait to do it off what each each triangle gets a little bit easier because they're into the routine. They're into the routine.

1091
02:12:36.690 --> 02:12:37.680
Sue: Do take a lot

1092
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:41.580
Ms. B: And they learn to build it up and then it all makes it worth it in the end.

1093
02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:56.700
Jessica Zaleski: And we've been able to streamline certain things. I mean, think of all the work that we did last summer. So in preparation for this year we put spent hours modifying going back and modifying those triangles and the doodle sheets and we didn't get to use me live if

1094
02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:00.120
Sarah Michaels: You will, it will you will

1095
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:11.400
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, no, I know, but it was it was. I mean, when you think we have like population dynamics and naturals like all that it has been Sue unjustified as Sarah likes to call it.

1096
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:18.480
Ms. B: You know so funny. That sounds like me, creating a whole biology website with modifications email support and then I'm teaching biotech

1097
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:21.690
Ms. B: Your whole life.

1098
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:25.650
Sarah Michaels: You will teach me some point

1099
02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:26.850
Ms. B: I know one day.

1100
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:28.350
Ms. B: One day when i when i get my

1101
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:29.280
Ms. B: Big britches on

1102
02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:39.630
Sue: The shine. Can you tell me I have not done this car thing before. Okay, are what you see is what you're seeing in your group, the same as what

1103
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:42.570
Sue: You saw with your students.

1104
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:43.980
Ms. B: Um, I would say.

1105
02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.710
Ms. B: I would say definitely I think to

1106
02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:56.100
Ms. B: The awesome thing about it was having that big poster board for them to draw their creations and the gallery walk to show it. So I think that was the only thing

1107
02:13:56.370 --> 02:14:01.050
Ms. B: That was very different because it you know when it's big and it's phenomenal.

1108
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:09.570
Ms. B: For a better a better term, you can really see what they're thinking. But I think it was hard for them to visualize in some sense, because the

1109
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:19.500
Ms. B: Picture was just so small and you're trying to see it on the screen. So I think it did take away from some of it. But I do think that they enjoyed it, just as much

1110
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:27.990
Ms. B: They didn't break their cars like my kids did I think like the first 30 seconds for cars were broken like there are only 20 and they're like 30 have you

1111
02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:31.770
Ms. B: Seen

1112
02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:40.140
Anisha Hassan: On zoom you can do a whiteboard, which I don't know if anybody wants to try doing whiteboard to draw the cars.

1113
02:14:40.770 --> 02:14:48.300
Sarah Michaels: I think it's a little hard to draw but but I could bet Elio would have been able to draw on a whiteboard. I don't know. It's

1114
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:52.290
Ms. B: A Nikki's a pretty good artists to I think she probably could have for her group to

1115
02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:54.060
Jessica Zaleski: I think it's just the

1116
02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.710
Ms. B: Demand is. Yeah, it's like

1117
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:59.250
Ms. B: Just like using annotation tools one necklace. Yeah, it's

1118
02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: It's so hard, if you've got an iPad or a touchscreen, you're fine. But I mean, trying to use the trackpad on the student Chromebooks for withdrawing tools is a nightmare.

1119
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:11.940
Ms. B: I'm thinking of just myself with DocuSign

1120
02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.640
Jessica Zaleski: Trying to do like write your signature. It's like, yeah, I look like a three year old.

1121
02:15:17.670 --> 02:15:18.300
Sarah Michaels: Trying to do a

1122
02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:20.010
Jessica Zaleski: Green Card. I mean,

1123
02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:33.630
Sarah Michaels: You know we did in in our more recent NGS sex virtual pathway when we're doing the air puppies and explaining how the bottle collapses. This may not make sense to just but

1124
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:47.190
Sarah Michaels: They actually created a template of the bottle first before the hot water goes in and they put all these little dots that could be moved and duplicated.

1125
02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:48.060
Sue: Drag and drop

1126
02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:51.090
Sarah Michaels: Drag and drop and then every group to

1127
02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:54.060
Jessica Zaleski: unknowingly firings or something like

1128
02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:56.160
Sarah Michaels: That it was Google draw

1129
02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:10.230
Sarah Michaels: Young and so we could create. I mean, this is for another time. But we could create a car, the outlines of a car and then people could try to play around with it might make it, I don't know, and

1130
02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:21.630
Sarah Michaels: But yeah, but I don't think. Anyway, I think this this worked this worked really, it is hard to see their drawings, but everybody did them and they held them up and

1131
02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:24.870
Sarah Michaels: It's hard to compile them into one.

1132
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:26.730
Sue: Rotten in this environment.

1133
02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:27.990
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, not

1134
02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:31.860
Sue: Drawing Your screen aspect where everybody can participate at the same time.

1135
02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:36.750
Sarah Michaels: You know another thing is if we could get them to upload photographs

1136
02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:49.980
Sarah Michaels: Another thing you can do is have people add stickies to the drawings, where they write questions or they say I really like this, or it was helpful that you explained it in words, as well as

1137
02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:59.790
Sarah Michaels: And and that's sometimes fun where they get to do a gallery walk and they can add stickies or ask questions. I mean, it can, it begins to be a way of

1138
02:17:01.770 --> 02:17:02.250
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, it's

1139
02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:16.050
Jessica Zaleski: An idea. I mean, let's, let's think about that for a minute. Should we have them upload to a slide deck and before or okay if or they send me a picture and I put their pictures on a jam board.

1140
02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:17.220
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, and

1141
02:17:18.390 --> 02:17:27.060
Jessica Zaleski: Present. They can either before they present or after they present, you know, we do a gallery walk and people can add comments.

1142
02:17:27.090 --> 02:17:29.310
Jessica Zaleski: Now, yeah. Do you think it should be.

1143
02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:33.090
Sue: After because if it's before they might be tempted to not pay attention to the

1144
02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:44.280
Jessica Zaleski: Wall, and that's what I was thinking. If they present without any one sharing. You know, it's like one team goes the next team goes in and then we say, Okay, we're gonna, I'm going to share the jam board.

1145
02:17:44.370 --> 02:17:51.690
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah. And you can go in and write comments and questions that you have on the other teams that could be really interesting to do.

1146
02:17:51.720 --> 02:18:01.050
Sarah Michaels: Definitely, yeah. I love that I really love that. And then, you know, I don't think we want to extend this. No, but you could you could

1147
02:18:01.710 --> 02:18:13.290
Sarah Michaels: At that point after there's been presentations and a gallery walk with stickies, we could say it. Do we have a group consensus, is there any one that we, or sometimes what

1148
02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:22.410
Sarah Michaels: What people would do is if they're similar models. And again, I think these may be different, we could pick one.

1149
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:34.920
Sarah Michaels: And and refine it so that we all, we all think, I don't know, maybe this is too too complicated. In this case, because I don't know how the different people show gears or

1150
02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:51.720
Sarah Michaels: Or bands or, you know, some does there. Let me just ask, does there have to be something elastic or spring like in inside the car. I think there does, doesn't there. I think there's a metal spring in there. And as you bring it back, it winds up tight.

1151
02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:57.120
Sarah Michaels: And yeah, and then it wants to unwind as it unwinds it

1152
02:18:57.510 --> 02:18:58.440
Jessica Zaleski: Pushes it forward.

1153
02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:00.570
Sue: I honestly haven't taken apart, since I was a kid.

1154
02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:03.630
Sue: Yeah, I was not going to do it now because I didn't want to know the answer.

1155
02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:04.890
Ms. B: Yeah, and I

1156
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:13.410
Ms. B: And I think some of those things where they were kind of beyond the grasp of my group. So the spring that that concept it either has to be a rope.

1157
02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:22.080
Ms. B: Or rubber band. It can't be like a spring something pushing it has to be a battery or it has to be a motor and i think i'm thinking more the logical sense

1158
02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:28.440
Ms. B: Versus kind of how things work. And they're like, this is clearly the motor and then this must be the battery so

1159
02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:38.070
Ms. B: I didn't want to populate that information, because then it's creating their model for them. But I did kind of throw terms out there, but they didn't take the bait.

1160
02:19:38.370 --> 02:19:48.030
Ms. B: as as as you'd say, so it was like yes so that band or that string but gears and frames were not in their conversation at all.

1161
02:19:48.210 --> 02:20:07.410
Sarah Michaels: Alright, so in ours. We have two gears and something that's spring like and so that will be available to the group. And we'll say, does there have to be, you know. Does, does there have to be a motor or does there have to be a spring. And I don't know if people will agree.

1162
02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:09.960
Jessica Zaleski: I just had a spring. They a

1163
02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:21.240
Jessica Zaleski: Guy started when we need was the last one to go and she said, you know, Reggie talked about. There's like kinetic energy and potential energy.

1164
02:20:21.330 --> 02:20:22.530
Sarah Michaels: You didn't have any of them.

1165
02:20:22.530 --> 02:20:31.020
Jessica Zaleski: Nikki said there's something like holding it back and then pushing it forward. And then he said,

1166
02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:41.190
Jessica Zaleski: I think there's a spring and when you pull it back. It gets tighter and then when you let it go. And so they were really building off each other and then Reggie's like

1167
02:20:41.490 --> 02:20:52.650
Jessica Zaleski: I think I like that, you know, I think I agree with that. And then it kind of just went around and so we built up and we were discussing like Tina asked, like where is the spring like, you know, and so they would hang about well,

1168
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:58.860
Jessica Zaleski: They think it's behind the wheels, because it's pushing in anyway. So it was. It's interesting to shot like that we had different

1169
02:20:59.490 --> 02:21:09.960
Jessica Zaleski: Conversations and how that if we had had, you know, if knee had been in my group and we had two other people who weren't at that level. I wonder where that would have gone

1170
02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:11.520
Jessica Zaleski: Where the conversation would have

1171
02:21:12.210 --> 02:21:21.390
Jessica Zaleski: Let it go out of respect, like sensing or, you know, it's just so fascinating to see the how the dynamics of the group affect the product at the

1172
02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:32.190
Ms. B: End yeah definitely makes a huge difference because I even mentioned, I said. So when you pull the car when you take the car and you pull it backwards. It goes forwards. Why do you think that happens.

1173
02:21:32.490 --> 02:21:49.410
Ms. B: Yeah. And then it was like there's a small rod. It could be a string. It could, but it, it just never cohesively came together. It was almost as if they were pinpointing certain areas of the car, but never actually putting the pieces together to make it one functioning unit.

1174
02:21:50.370 --> 02:22:04.350
Sarah Michaels: Well, well, maybe that group should go first, and then another group that has a spring. And then, and maybe and maybe ours would go last because it has a spring and

1175
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:10.650
Sarah Michaels: Gears did did did one group have gears are still yeah

1176
02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:13.320
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, three years.

1177
02:22:14.610 --> 02:22:15.870
Sue: Sure, where they are.

1178
02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:18.780
Sue: Yeah, middle, and some associated with the bad

1179
02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:19.860
Sarah Michaels: Guy. So that would go

1180
02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:24.630
Sarah Michaels: I was impressed with what, what's the girl.

1181
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:32.130
Sarah Michaels: The one who was she presented first and she had a band and she wrote

1182
02:22:33.210 --> 02:22:38.580
Sarah Michaels: Band. Do you remember Alma. Was she the Albanian speaking

1183
02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:40.020
Alma Martinez: Yeah, I was Selena

1184
02:22:40.470 --> 02:22:51.060
Sarah Michaels: Selena Selena got us really it was interesting. I mean, she she wasn't as talking to. Oh, and then Leandro who had his car didn't work.

1185
02:22:52.740 --> 02:23:06.270
Sarah Michaels: He said, oh, you know, I think I saw one so I took one apart when I was little, and he really got excited about it. So I felt good, that he he started a new what what it must have been anywhere and and getting a car will be

1186
02:23:06.570 --> 02:23:07.680
Sue: Great. I'm gonna make sure I get it.

1187
02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:10.920
Sue: I wouldn't. How many kids are actually going to look this up.

1188
02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:23.160
Ms. B: Well, I will. That's the last thing I said, and I said no Google search. You can revise and modified based on your manipulations and moving with your model. So I wouldn't be surprised if salaam comes up with a prototype now.

1189
02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:23.940
Ms. B: Yeah, when she

1190
02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:29.370
Sarah Michaels: Oh yeah, good salaam do what she very

1191
02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:35.220
Ms. B: Good. Did she did. She did very well. I mean, in the end, she ended up volunteering to be

1192
02:23:35.250 --> 02:23:37.350
Sarah Michaels: The presenter, right. That's right.

1193
02:23:37.410 --> 02:23:52.980
Ms. B: She modified off of other people's models. But the interesting thing was we were discussing how many, how many wheels. Do you have does everyone in a group have four it was like, yes, yes, yes. And then right before we're about to go and breakout rooms, someone says they have six

1194
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:53.370
Yeah.

1195
02:23:55.350 --> 02:23:56.340
Ms. B: I'm like, there's only four

1196
02:23:58.680 --> 02:23:59.220
Jessica Zaleski: Well, thank you.

1197
02:24:00.510 --> 02:24:03.780
Ms. B: So long goes, oh gosh, I don't think the model is good.

1198
02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:06.240
Sarah Michaels: Yeah.

1199
02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:08.460
Ms. B: She goes, so do I have to do another model.

1200
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:12.570
Ms. B: Oh my gosh, they're there, they're wonderful.

1201
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:19.140
Raquel Fernandes: Years, and I think salaam did mention year but she didn't use the word year she

1202
02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:20.130
Ms. B: didn't use the word. Yep.

1203
02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:26.430
Raquel Fernandes: Yeah, she she said it was like a monster like a flower and her drawing. It was a gear. Yeah.

1204
02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:29.400
Raquel Fernandes: Yeah, I think her group didn't have a lot of vocabulary.

1205
02:24:29.490 --> 02:24:29.910
Sarah Michaels: At them.

1206
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:38.730
Jessica Zaleski: But they have the concept around and college and vocabulary is this is like another example of the gateway vocabulary.

1207
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:39.960
Jessica Zaleski: Like, what is the

1208
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:51.240
Jessica Zaleski: vocabulary that you might need to participate and, especially, you might have the concept of it. But if you don't know what the word is then we're kind of talking around it.

1209
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:59.250
Jessica Zaleski: So this is an interesting tie in here because if we had shown a picture and asked them, What is, what do you think this is called

1210
02:24:59.340 --> 02:25:01.890
Sarah Michaels: exceeded the territory too much, but

1211
02:25:01.890 --> 02:25:04.770
Ms. B: Now they. That was what I was nervous. I didn't want to

1212
02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:06.180
Jessica Zaleski: See it, yeah.

1213
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:13.470
Ms. B: And she said, the flower made the car speed and I'm looking at that and I'm like that. That's totally a gear, but I'm like, I cannot

1214
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:27.060
Sarah Michaels: Know, right now, now that it's going to come out in the presentations, we should say, does everyone in every. Does everyone know what a gear is AND SAY IT. YOU KNOW IT what is IT IN PORTUGUESE. Yeah. Is it, is it a cognitive, probably not.

1215
02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:30.120
Raquel Fernandes: I actually

1216
02:25:31.170 --> 02:25:31.740
Raquel Fernandes: Know,

1217
02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:33.720
Sarah Michaels: What is it in Spanish.

1218
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:37.830
Alma Martinez: A year. I am not sure either

1219
02:25:38.370 --> 02:25:39.000
Raquel Fernandes: use that word.

1220
02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:39.690
Yeah.

1221
02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:43.260
Sarah Michaels: Like if you're in a car new shift gears.

1222
02:25:44.700 --> 02:25:48.270
Raquel Fernandes: But it's different. We don't say year when you say we're shifting gears.

1223
02:25:48.390 --> 02:25:49.080
Sarah Michaels: Oh, okay.

1224
02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:50.010
Raquel Fernandes: Oh, it's

1225
02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:53.310
Jessica Zaleski: Definitely not a card game.

1226
02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:53.970
No.

1227
02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:57.900
Ms. B: No, it's beautiful.

1228
02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:58.650
Ms. B: But definitely not a

1229
02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:00.900
Sarah Michaels: Similar in Spanish. What is it,

1230
02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:09.060
Alma Martinez: That it's gonna hate sounds similar, but he also don't say that race like shifting gears in the car. We don't say that. Okay. Okay.

1231
02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:14.940
Jessica Zaleski: So what do you say, I'm just curious, what, how would you would you say is it more like changing gears or

1232
02:26:15.210 --> 02:26:18.720
Alma Martinez: We say like changing its or velocities

1233
02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:24.450
Alma Martinez: Car. So when we will, if you're just like, this is the ones too.

1234
02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.200
Jessica Zaleski: So how would you say I am changing gears in Spanish.

1235
02:26:29.310 --> 02:26:33.360
Alma Martinez: We would say like, come and go, but mostly done

1236
02:26:33.450 --> 02:26:33.930
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, can

1237
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:38.220
Raquel Fernandes: I make such a difference.

1238
02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:47.490
Raquel Fernandes: We say changing to like mood there but we say Marcia, which is a type of way that you walk

1239
02:26:47.610 --> 02:26:48.300
Jessica Zaleski: There was a

1240
02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:52.410
Raquel Fernandes: Few horses. So like how

1241
02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:57.360
Sarah Michaels: We say date or something, again, the horses have different game.

1242
02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:58.410
Raquel Fernandes: That's kind of

1243
02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:03.780
Jessica Zaleski: Okay. Wow, that's awesome. So I really, really should have studied linguistics.

1244
02:27:03.810 --> 02:27:04.920
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe from Dad Well,

1245
02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:07.560
Jessica Zaleski: I just could learn about this all day long.

1246
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:10.680
Ms. B: Yeah, I'm starting Rosetta Stone next week.

1247
02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:11.580
Jessica Zaleski: Or what

1248
02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:12.870
Sarah Michaels: I'm working on Spanish

1249
02:27:13.650 --> 02:27:14.520
Sue: Oh, you don't know you just

1250
02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:23.430
Ms. B: Haven't I haven't figured out which because there's so there's so many. But I just said that was one of my goals for 2021 I want to start Rosetta Stone for something with the free time that I don't have

1251
02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:32.940
Jessica Zaleski: So I was just gonna say before we leave. You know, when Sarah, you were talking about should we try to come to a consensus. I mean, I do feel like

1252
02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:38.940
Jessica Zaleski: It. I don't think we can because I don't know like that we want to, but I think it's okay to say to the students like

1253
02:27:39.390 --> 02:27:44.520
Jessica Zaleski: Do we have an agreed upon model, you know, and, and we're going to stop here, but like

1254
02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:59.040
Jessica Zaleski: It as if scientists, if, if we have, we fully answered our driving question, like if we were going to pursue this. Do we need to keep going to fully answer this question and just get them to say like there's enough that we could keep going with it.

1255
02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:00.000
Ms. B: Going with it. Yeah.

1256
02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:03.480
Jessica Zaleski: But scientists would keep, you know, you keep up.

1257
02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:21.930
Sarah Michaels: And I think I think when we have ideas like a spring or a rubber band which is different from a string. I don't see how a string could accelerate the car or a rope, but I could understand how a spring could get tighter and then tune

1258
02:28:23.010 --> 02:28:42.210
Sarah Michaels: So we could ask, does there have to be a spring or somebody has gears do does there have to be, you know, is it, is it possible that you know we could we could have a car that had does not have a gear or have no spring. I don't know the answer to that.

1259
02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.440
Ms. B: Actually, yeah. And they did.

1260
02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:44.190
Ms. B: They

1261
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:45.510
Ms. B: Go ahead. Sorry.

1262
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.160
Sue: Yo yo is move across

1263
02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:50.580
Ms. B: Yeah, that's a string that's exactly what I was. Yeah.

1264
02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:54.150
Sarah Michaels: Oh, wait a second. How does that work.

1265
02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.630
Sue: Oh, when you just like if you you moving the yo yo up and down the string gets

1266
02:28:57.690 --> 02:28:58.980
Ms. B: Around the restaurant gets run

1267
02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:00.810
Jessica Zaleski: Bringing a yo yo

1268
02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:03.270
Sue: It moves by itself across the table.

1269
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:04.560
Ms. B: That was the same thing.

1270
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:12.030
Sarah Michaels: What brings the yo up, what is the force is it that it gets. How does that work.

1271
02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:14.700
Ms. B: I have no idea.

1272
02:29:17.010 --> 02:29:18.060
You just, you just

1273
02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:23.550
Sarah Michaels: You just blew my theory that a string couldn't work, but of course it could. It's

1274
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:26.070
Ms. B: Just that we both we both popped into the same thing.

1275
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:35.250
Anisha Hassan: elastic energy you tied it up this training if you're storing potential energy which converts to elastic.

1276
02:29:35.250 --> 02:29:36.420
Ms. B: And elastic energy

1277
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:43.980
Ms. B: And one of the kids said they after we move past the string. She said, maybe it's a rubber. Maybe it's a rubber wire or an elastic.

1278
02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:46.410
Sarah Michaels: Yeah, this is amazing anyway.

1279
02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:59.070
Sarah Michaels: I think the kids went anyway. I was just very impressed. I think, I think so. I remember when Sean did it mean the kids got very into it, which was really cool.

1280
02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:09.690
Sarah Michaels: And and they did present. I think we have video of it. We should go back and look at it at some point. But I was really impressed with how these guys did what they did.

1281
02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:13.740
Ms. B: That model cars just something pretty

1282
02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:18.030
Sarah Michaels: Well, you don't know. You don't know the magic tubes. That's another

1283
02:30:18.090 --> 02:30:20.400
Jessica Zaleski: Now one thing that the magic tubes are

1284
02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:21.120
Jessica Zaleski: Great for because

1285
02:30:21.450 --> 02:30:22.320
Ms. B: That's why you want them.

1286
02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:23.580
Ms. B: For that

1287
02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:30.120
Jessica Zaleski: Magic yeah we oh yeah I mean those magic tubes. I mean, my mind is still blown by the magic to because

1288
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:34.290
Jessica Zaleski: I still haven't figured the magic tooth out. And I don't ever really want to understand them.

1289
02:30:34.470 --> 02:30:35.580
Ms. B: It would ruin it for you.

1290
02:30:35.820 --> 02:30:37.890
Jessica Zaleski: And I can genuinely tell the students like

1291
02:30:38.010 --> 02:30:39.390
Jessica Zaleski: I don't

1292
02:30:39.690 --> 02:30:45.420
Jessica Zaleski: Know, I don't know, like Sue tried to kind of explain the model to me, but I didn't fully

1293
02:30:45.570 --> 02:30:49.200
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, you know, and I was just like, No, I want to be amazed by the magic tubes.

1294
02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:52.170
Sue: And I had to tell all the kids, my husband, put it all together.

1295
02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:54.480
Ms. B: He couldn't

1296
02:30:55.530 --> 02:30:58.980
Jessica Zaleski: That would have been me. God, I wasn't in charge of putting those things together.

1297
02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:09.720
Sarah Michaels: Both. Both. Sue and I have made them, but I wonder if we have exactly cuz Mine has a ring in it. Does yours sign does not. You're just cross them. Okay.

1298
02:31:09.930 --> 02:31:25.290
Jessica Zaleski: And it's so cool because so many of the models that the kids have come up with in the past have a ring, and then others do not have a ring you know they've got some type of pulley or no ring or some have a ring. So it is fascinating. Like, and that you know there could be different models.

1299
02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:25.650
Jessica Zaleski: That

1300
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:27.300
Jessica Zaleski: Work with that's a really good

1301
02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:39.510
Sarah Michaels: Point, there really could be two different pull back cars that look different inside. I mean, I'm sure there's a there's a typical one nowadays, but I bet you could make

1302
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:50.100
Sarah Michaels: Anyway, that's an interesting thing. And that was an advantage of the tubes, because the kids could actually make one and test their model, we can't do that here.

1303
02:31:52.140 --> 02:32:02.700
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we're going to meet on Wednesday I and Tina. Do you want me to. I'm going to include you in the group and include you in the email for the, you know, in case you want to come to the meeting, but will be meeting Wednesday night.

1304
02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:03.840
Sue: So we have an open

1305
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:05.010
Jessica Zaleski: Meeting and john I

1306
02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.260
Sue: Will always be there and whoever shows up shows up.

1307
02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:11.490
Jessica Zaleski: Yep. And we're just going to use the same zoom link. So for our meeting. Great.

1308
02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:14.430
Sarah Michaels: Alright guys, this was wonderful. I think

1309
02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:15.780
Sarah Michaels: Start end

1310
02:32:16.170 --> 02:32:19.260
Jessica Zaleski: Alright. Have a great day everyone. Bye.
