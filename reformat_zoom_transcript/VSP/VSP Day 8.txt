Anisha Hassan: And i'm like.

6
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:43.230
Anisha Hassan: yeah anytime you want to open turn on the heat with like $200 $200 dollars yeah so you're gonna be with online UV Leandro and Salaam.

7
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.970
Alma Araujo: wait for the part that we're doing the experiment or.

8
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.760
Anisha Hassan: No, no, not experiment, this is the point part.

9
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.510
Okay.

10
00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.990
Anisha Hassan: yeah somehow i'm like the teachers are going to be their own group and i'm in the teachers group.

11
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.030
Anisha Hassan: yeah.

12
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.440
Anisha Hassan: yeah.

13

Alma Araujo: Oh wait for that part like we are going to share our faith right.

29
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:36.240
Anisha Hassan: No, you don't have to share your screen, I mean you can share your screen, but the others can also share their screen there's no rules, but basically what's the first we'll do the experiment part and then.

30
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.890
Anisha Hassan: Sarah will explain the poem and what to do and we'll do the first two lines together as a whole group and then we'll go into groups of four.

31
00:03:47.460 --> 00:04:00.570
Anisha Hassan: And do the other parts and then come to a consensus and the group will read out do a recitation the English part in our groups we're going to do exactly what we did yeah basically okay.

32
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.210
Anisha Hassan: But don't tell too much.

33
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.710
Alma Araujo: They like yes, I don't know what that word itself.

34
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.920
Anisha Hassan: I mean raquel will have a Vietnamese speaker so that might change things oh yeah.

35
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.500
Raquel Fernandes: i'll be interesting.

36
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.760
yeah.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.710
Anisha Hassan: Oh no.

54
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.780
Sarah Michaels: I brought some grapes I didn't have strawberries i'm doing great so I don't know.

55
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.780
Anisha Hassan: yeah i'm doing Mandarin I.

56
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.260
Sarah Michaels: supplies.

57
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.820
Yes.

58
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.110
Alma Araujo: I think I just bought too many measuring and then I could not finish them for this for sure.

59
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.100
Anisha Hassan: I mean, even if it's rotten it's delicious DNA.

60
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.350
Alma Araujo: yeah yeah.

61
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.220
Anisha Hassan: I mean we could ask that to sue address being being rotten makes a difference.

62
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:23.790
Sarah Michaels: yeah there's so many questions I have like between living and dead so like let's say you have a plant.

63
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.820
Sarah Michaels: And it's.

64
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.790
Sarah Michaels: It is it still living.

65
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.900
Sarah Michaels: You know, like is a grain of rice alive.

66
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.470
Sarah Michaels: Is there still DNA, you know they just stay I there's so much I don't get about.

67
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.440
Sarah Michaels: About cells and stuff like that.

68
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.450
yeah.

69
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.900
Raquel Fernandes: yeah it's really interesting.

70
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.950
Sarah Michaels: For like a dead person, a dead fish something like that is is the DNA.

71
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.370
Sarah Michaels: The same yeah.

72
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:11.370
Anisha Hassan: I mean, it should be, because you know when people die bb magic danny's for like crime scenes and everything right.

73
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.930
Sarah Michaels: Mike what is.

74
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.780
Raquel Fernandes: What is DNA made of his proteins and.

75
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.730
Raquel Fernandes: nucleotides yes.

76
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.960
So drew day.

77
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.770
Sarah Michaels: Or what are nucleotides tomato.

78
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.640
Anisha Hassan: Yes, proteins right, no, no.

79
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.420
Anisha Hassan: No, no.

80
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:36.630
Anisha Hassan: So there's like nucleotides amino acids and those are different types of molecules so proteins are made of amino acids and.

81
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.400
Anisha Hassan: I didn't it.

82
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.780
Alma Araujo: Was it.

83
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.640
Alma Araujo: wasn't it sugar phosphate and.

84
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:52.860
Alma Araujo: yeah and then nitrogen base I think yeah it's like three different molecules and they're like it's like you can put them like puzzles together and then you can like make them seem like a different.

85
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:57.150
Raquel Fernandes: type of we do do those monocles need something to stay together.

86
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.520
Anisha Hassan: But.

87
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.120
Alma Araujo: We saw this in class like over a year ago in biochemistry and we don't remember right.

88
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:19.710
Sarah Michaels: Is it is it the way the molecules link together, I mean you can have these really long strands of protein.

89
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.030
Anisha Hassan: yeah yeah.

90
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.380
Anisha Hassan: I, like our skin is made of protein.

91
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.210
Anisha Hassan: Structural proteins um yeah.

92
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.540
Sarah Michaels: I would definitely have wanted to go into biology or.

93
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.730
Sarah Michaels: biochemistry if I had had it if I hit enter and good teachers.

94
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.120
Anisha Hassan: A, it is a lot, I never like I didn't even like biology and Clark.

95
00:08:51.060 --> 00:09:05.670
Anisha Hassan: Some parts are definitely interesting like always see DNA and genetics sounds very interesting, but then you learn about like the tree of life and different genesis and you have to memorize 50 things and Those are just a bit.

96
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.800
Sarah Michaels: ridiculous, I mean.

97
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:24.510
Anisha Hassan: yeah I guess if you're into it it's like because i'm like interested in history, I don't have an issue with memorizing dates are like remembering stuff but if you're not interested It just seems like such hard work.

98
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:28.890
yeah.

99
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:39.210
Anisha Hassan: i'm Sarah we should all meet up after this ends, to talk about what to do with the data.

100
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.230
When.

101
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.320
Sarah Michaels: Should we be concerned that we don't have soo and jess.

102
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.520
yeah.

103
00:09:52.830 --> 00:10:00.660
Raquel Fernandes: They would meet before to talk about okay things even even things there were not related to science spot so all right.

104
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:18.330
Raquel Fernandes: Oh, Catherine yesterday message me privately saying that she i'm asking if this was the last weekend, and when I said that it was she was like oh it's so sad.

105
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.140
Raquel Fernandes: So i'm excited that he's enjoying this.

106
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:31.320
Sarah Michaels: Yes, I had the sense to and she's you know she's grown i've seen yeah that that makes me really happy because.

107
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:39.300
Sarah Michaels: I feel like it would be cool to get their text numbers and just keep in touch with them there's just such.

108
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.210
Sarah Michaels: such great kids.

109
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.780
Raquel Fernandes: I was gonna ask that can I messaged her my phone number, maybe.

110
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.760
Sarah Michaels: Yes, yes yeah she I think that would be fantastic.

111
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.130
Anisha Hassan: Should we text them or.

112
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.580
Sarah Michaels: send them an email saying we're on zoom.

113
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.030
Sarah Michaels: yeah but maybe a text wouldn't hurt yeah.

114
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.520
Anisha Hassan: Do you have their number.

115
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.280
Anisha Hassan: yeah.

116
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.360
Sarah Michaels: no idea how this is going to go so we're gonna have fun and play by ear.

117
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:21.480
Jessica Zaleski: That is fine, so um do we want to do anything with the challenge question, or do we do we want to kind of just do that as a fun warm up, do you think it's possible you know I didn't do you think.

118
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.750
Jessica Zaleski: A person can share more DNA with their parents or with a sibling and just kind of see.

119
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.350
Sarah Michaels: I just.

120
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.550
Sarah Michaels: Close yeah I think that that question yep.

121
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.030
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so i'll just put that slide up and then we'll just have a talk about it.

122
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:44.670
Jessica Zaleski: And you know if it's not going anywhere we'll end it, you know what I mean, and if it is will will still ended at the time we feel is appropriate, you know.

123
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.440
Sarah Michaels: But you know it might it might be worth it to do a waterfall chat let them have a little bit of.

124
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.770
Sarah Michaels: john and then doing waterfall chat and then talk.

125
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.070
Jessica Zaleski: hi Sabina hi reggie.

126
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.750

155
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.110
Anisha Hassan: Now.

156
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.120
Susan Snay: we're gonna do that first and let it settle to sit for a little bit okay.

157
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.510
Susan Snay: Because you get the if all my all my stuff is sitting here at my desk.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:41.370
Reggie: This is fun.

315
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.140
Ms. B: Yes, that's good that's much better.

316
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.180
Reggie: He said soap and water yeah I.

317
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:45.750
Susan Snay: Know yeah.

318
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.640
Susan Snay: So so oh.

319
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.720
And the dish so.

320
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.180
Susan Snay: And a little bit of water.

321
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.060
Susan Snay: So now i'm going to add my soap and it does not have to be exact.

322
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.340
Susan Snay: But since Sarah says we have this boom, I will use it right.

323
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.850
Okay.

324
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.470
Tell me.

325
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.080
What do you feel after.

326
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.080
Jessica Zaleski: salton soap.

327
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.050
Leandro Graterol: Yes, he's got a.

328
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.400
Sarah Michaels: little bit of water two years it looks really it doesn't look.

329
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.050
Susan Snay: Very liquidity minus.

330
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:36.780
Susan Snay: Okay that's what you want, and you don't want bubbles so you're not trying to get bubbles like you just want to mix it slowly.

331
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.120
Sarah Michaels: Oh, I got some bubbles.

332
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.970
Susan Snay: Up he's gonna sit for a while anyway okay.

333
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.730
Jessica Zaleski: So we have done nothing with the rubbing alcohol correct no okay.

334
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:51.510
Miss.

335
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.760
salam: enough to live without them know.

336
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.940
Jessica Zaleski: add some water, I think, maybe salon.

337
00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.550
Jessica Zaleski: And each years that's good.

338
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.660
Susan Snay: tell you look I said Venus looks good it looks good.

339
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:13.380
Susan Snay: Alma I think you need to add is how's your you got look what you have enough liquid in yours yep.

340
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.880
Susan Snay: Okay, oh Sarah you have plenty in your.

341
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.980
salam: wounds of this job.

342
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.950
Jessica Zaleski: This a few drops alarm not not spoon.

343
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.280
Reggie: Oh we're looking for here.

344
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.210
Jessica Zaleski: No.

345
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.700
Reggie: I do like to school poses so.

346
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.040
Reggie: it's fine it's.

347
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.630
Susan Snay: Really, not about not like making a cake, believe me.

348
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.230
Susan Snay: it's a lot harder to make a cake.

349
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.210
Reggie: than it is to extract DNA so that's fine.

350
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.790
yeah that's good.

351
00:26:52.050 --> 00:27:01.710
Susan Snay: All right now, Miss me, let me ask what your experience with this is i've seen videos where it tells you to wait, the longer you wait, the more DNA you get but.

352
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:10.290
Ms. B: I ideally if you give it like a three to five minute wait at the minimum you'll usually get a better yield okay gives me more time to that.

353
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.810
Jessica Zaleski: Well i'm sorry miss be.

354
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.520
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe this is a good time for us to look at that challenge question one.

355
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.290
Jessica Zaleski: yeah Okay, while it's processing.

356
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.880
Jessica Zaleski: Let me go ahead and.

357
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.110
Jessica Zaleski: share my screen oh nisha Can you help me out with that.

358
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.150
Jessica Zaleski: it's the second.

359
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.890
Anisha Hassan: yeah I just did that.

360
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:34.620
Susan Snay: Perfect Thank you everybody is if their bag and just put it aside for three minutes, and then we will move on.

361
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.380
Leandro Graterol: Like bananas, what we need to do with this boy disarming.

362
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.030
Jessica Zaleski: And with the dish soap and your fruit.

363
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.270
salam: Have the fruits let's begin to look like dash of.

364
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.110
Susan Snay: salt.

365
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.420
And a little bit of water, looking around in your bed.

366
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.870
Keyshawn: And he.

367
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.500
Sarah Michaels: Did it again kitchen.

368
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.930
Leandro Graterol: Can you happy, what did you send me a.

369
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.190
Ms. B: Note the alcohol is the final step.

370
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.800
Leandro Graterol: So I just put it in the chat.

371
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:26.010
Jessica Zaleski: In your bag, you should have fruit salt so and a little water.

372
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.420
Susan Snay: villain in the bag just put it aside.

373
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.250
Jessica Zaleski: alright.

374
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:59.430
Jessica Zaleski: So thinking about yesterday and everything we've been learning about passing on genetic information in general.

375
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:15.750
Jessica Zaleski: Who has the potential, the possibility of having more DNA in common, is it a child and its parent or two siblings.

376
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:27.030
Jessica Zaleski: Okay that's coming up, I don't know why there's such a lack your two siblings so we want you to take a minute or so and think about this we're going to do a waterfall chat for this so think about.

377
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:35.190
Jessica Zaleski: Who could possibly have more DNA in common, a child and its mother or father.

378
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:43.230
Jessica Zaleski: or a brother and a sister or two sisters and you can think in terms of you know, think in terms of yourself if you have siblings do you think you have.

379
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:55.320
Jessica Zaleski: More DNA, in common with your mom or your dad or with your brother or sister based on what we've learned about how.

380
00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:09.960
Jessica Zaleski: genetic material is passed from parent offspring take a few minutes here think about this, we want you to type your answer in the chat but do not hit enter just wait just wait.

381
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:20.940
Jessica Zaleski: and honestly, if you have an easier time typing in if you're a Spanish speaker and you want to type your answer in Spanish go ahead, we can translate that after.

382
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:32.580
Jessica Zaleski: Kathleen if you want to type in Portuguese go ahead and type in Portuguese we don't want you to have to worry about how to explain it best in English okay so just think about that.

383
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.730
Jessica Zaleski: Type what you think in the chat and why, but do not hit enter.

384
00:31:50.730 --> 00:32:02.820
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so at this point, everyone should be typing into the chat what they think and why they think that don't hit enter yet, but get your answer ready to share.

385
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.020
Jessica Zaleski: i'm excited to see what they're going I am too.

386
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:55.350
Jessica Zaleski: i've been asking a few people this this question, people who are not in biology or anything like what do you and your some of our colleagues business today i've been asking them what they think interesting answers okay um alright everyone go ahead and hit enter on your response.

387
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.580
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, good excellent.

388
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.090
Jessica Zaleski: This is grace.

389
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.840
Jessica Zaleski: This is great okay.

390
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.060
About half and half.

391
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.200
Oh.

392
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:48.240
Sarah Michaels: For Nora and katelyn can you just say a little bit about why you think if you just wrote what you think just say why need to.

393
00:33:49.800 --> 00:34:00.930
noora: Think, I think the reason why is because the siblings get DNA from both the parents well the child gets DNA from the mom the mom gets DNA from her mom like that her parents.

394
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.850
Thanks.

395
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.260
Jessica Zaleski: Work, how can you help us out with translation from for catlin.

396
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.790
Anisha Hassan: And all more, could you Jim smoothly Andrews slow.

397
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.240
Jessica Zaleski: i'm trying to guess what it says oh Okay, they can have the same DNA.

398
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.500
Jessica Zaleski: siblings because they have the same DNA DNA okay.

399
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.400
Alma Araujo: Leandro it says siblings because they can have the same name.

400
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:49.140
Susan Snay: What do you mean What do you mean the same DNA leandra explain that a little bit more.

401
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:56.460
Leandro Graterol: Because the game they come from the other and the mom so you can have the same being.

402
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.020
Jessica Zaleski: You all siblings have the same DNA.

403
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.740
Jessica Zaleski: No, no okay.

404
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:27.990
Jessica Zaleski: So let's see we've got how many people think siblings 1234567 about seven people think siblings and one two.

405
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:36.150
Jessica Zaleski: looks like three people think parents nice said, both before yeah.

406
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.060
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

407
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:47.730
Jessica Zaleski: It seems like more people think siblings then traveled in its parents i'm think back to the possible.

408
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:55.560
Sarah Michaels: Today, just one quick question reggie you're one of the people who thinks a child in its parent, could you just explain why you think that.

409
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.330
Reggie: I cuz i'm, as we know, like a chromosome just the way that our past like for them to have direct care parents and stuff.

410
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:12.480
Reggie: So the reason why I think a child and the parents could like regain our chromosomes which big part of DNA from my parents something a child and the parents gonna have more in common.

411
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:13.980
Jessica Zaleski: Right.

412
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.040
Jessica Zaleski: Because they are the source right.

413
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.480
Reggie: yeah.

414
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:35.910
Jessica Zaleski: So reggie said child and parent Nikki said child and its parent and so Nikki I like Nikki can you unmute and share what you typed in, for your answer with us.

415
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:54.270
Nhi Huynh: yeah so I believe that i'm a trial and his parent have more than a income and because the child receive a half Lloyd cells from the data and halfway sale from the mom so as a result, they get like Bo D amp a from the parents.

416
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.400
Jessica Zaleski: So I love that you did you talked about the half Lloyd, and you said half.

417
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:18.300
Jessica Zaleski: So, like what is the most DNA that a child could share that, like the percentage wise what's the what's the highest percent of DNA that a parent could share with its mother or father.

418
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.690
Nhi Huynh: i'm not sure.

419
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.550
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe, let me, let me try to say that again so if we think of.

420
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:34.350
Jessica Zaleski: Our DNA is we have 100% of our own DNA how much of that DNA did we got from our mother.

421
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.590
Nhi Huynh: Our mother and father.

422
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:38.580
Susan Snay: Right.

423
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.890
Jessica Zaleski: 50 from the mother and 50 from the father okay.

424
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:56.160
Sarah Michaels: So let me just ask a question about that so could a mother and a child share 70% of their DNA in common or 90%.

425
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.020
Sarah Michaels: Is it good a mother and a child share.

426
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.320
Sarah Michaels: A whole lot almost all of their DNA in common, he can.

427
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.490
Leandro Graterol: I will say.

428
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.590
Leandro Graterol: Yes.

429
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.330
salam: Because.

430
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.650
salam: I think the father's here to some DNA.

431
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:21.840
Reggie: They have an extra chromosome.

432
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:26.880
Oh, what do you mean by that.

433
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.870
Reggie: Because i'm Okay, so you start way so.

434
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:44.400
Reggie: it's basically isn't chromosomes basic Mayra DNA right and you said it was called if the mother, yes, more the DNA when they basically resolved to have them have an extra chromosome.

435
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:51.240
Jessica Zaleski: that's an interesting thought so we didn't really talk about if we were.

436
00:38:51.240 --> 00:39:10.830
Jessica Zaleski: Including any type of abnormality right we did see one yeah we did we talked about it yesterday in this example we didn't mention it, but what if we were talking about just a normal situation um you know again if we're talking about humans.

437
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:22.290
Susan Snay: Who average like yeah to average siblings with no genetic issues or a child and a parent with you know normal child normal parent, with no genetic issues.

438
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:46.620
Jessica Zaleski: So Nikki said that you get 50% from your mom and 50% from your dad and then they're asked, is it possible for a child, a normal child, where there are no chromosomal issues to have more than 50% of their DNA come from their mom or their dad.

439
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:52.890
Susan Snay: What do you know about the chromosomes that that child receives where did they.

440
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:55.800
really get them from.

441
00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.930
salam: know I think they got 50% from each parent.

442
00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:13.140
Susan Snay: Can we prove that with math like how many chromosomes total does it does a human half.

443
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.340
salam: And where did they get those chromosomes from.

444
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.080
Reggie: their parents.

445
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.940
salam: Parents from the parents.

446
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.440
Reggie: 2023 from each.

447
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.660
Susan Snay: 23 and 23 so that's 50% right.

448
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.640
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

449
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:48.810
Jessica Zaleski: So now let's think about this, then, is it possible for two siblings to have more than 50% of their DNA in common.

450
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:50.760
salam: No.

451
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.230
salam: Well, the question again.

452
00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:03.600
Jessica Zaleski: So is it possible for two siblings a brother and a sister or sisters and brothers to have more than 50% because.

453
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.170
Leandro Graterol: We said.

454
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.250
Jessica Zaleski: Is it possible to say oh yeah yeah tell us more about that Leandro.

455
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.750
Leandro Graterol: Because easy.

456
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.020
Leandro Graterol: Well way.

457
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:32.010
Leandro Graterol: I say yes, but I say i'm thinking, the if you want simply have to fit 2% on of DNA and there are others gambling out the same DNA that his sister so he's 100% right because you have the same DNA.

458
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:38.130
Susan Snay: What would they what would they be called if they have the same DNA and.

459
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.820
Jessica Zaleski: um what do we call that when two siblings have the exact same DNA.

460
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.760
Jessica Zaleski: wins what kind of twins.

461
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.500
Nhi Huynh: identical yeah.

462
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.400
Call.

463
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.050
Jessica Zaleski: So I guess that.

464
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.870
Susan Snay: that's an example of siblings.

465
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.030
Reggie: made the Miss what's the percentage.

466
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.210
Because.

467
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:03.630
Jessica Zaleski: What is the percentage Can somebody reggie ask that question again and see who can help out with that.

468
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:14.580
Reggie: Oh what's the percentage that like to be on you like to service just same DNA doesn't do like i'm like 8000 like different like DNA like much yeah it's.

469
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:22.230
Reggie: it's kind of hard to have two twins that say the same DNA or any like two siblings share the same DNA.

470
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:29.220
Jessica Zaleski: So, say, do you mean like outside of twins because we know that there are identical twins right that have the exact same DNA.

471
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:29.820
yeah.

472
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:38.010
Jessica Zaleski: yeah let's let's just take a look i'm going to go back a little bit reggie you're talking about this here right there are.

473
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:46.230
Jessica Zaleski: yeah million pot, I mean that's a lot, but if we go back and let me go back here for a second.

474
00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:58.590
Jessica Zaleski: And again we're not talking about humans exactly here because we've only got three pairs But what if.

475
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.490
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, I made two.

476
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:12.300
Jessica Zaleski: And they got one day two way and three day right, and then the other.

477
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:27.660
Jessica Zaleski: also got one a two a three A, and the same you know what I mean maybe they got to be to a prime one, the prime and.

478
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.970
Jessica Zaleski: Three a prime.

479
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:40.170
Susan Snay: Are you saying that if the mother's eggs were were given chromosomes that were the same.

480
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:47.340
Jessica Zaleski: yeah yeah she received like the same thing exact chromosomes yeah one be prime one be prime.

481
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.650
Susan Snay: And both of those siblings got that.

482
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:57.990
Jessica Zaleski: mm hmm okay excellent make sure, and then the sperm had the two sperm had similar.

483
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:00.810
Jessica Zaleski: Is that possible.

484
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:08.610
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, how was it decided that what goes into the sperm what chromosomes and that egg.

485
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:09.600
housing.

486
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.370
Nhi Huynh: randomly.

487
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.180
randomly.

488
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:14.370
yeah.

489
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:24.960
Susan Snay: So is it a possibility that siblings would have more DNA, in common with each other than parents and a sibling.

490
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:26.430
salam: yeah.

491
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.130
Jessica Zaleski: He says no.

492
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:32.880
salam: Oh wait.

493
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:42.630
salam: So, what was the question is like, is it possible that siblings have our DNA like i'm in common than parents know.

494
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.040
Susan Snay: Rather than.

495
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.830
Sarah Michaels: They would with a parent one of their parents.

496
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:49.410
salam: i'm thinking.

497
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:55.290
salam: yeah.

498
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:07.020
Sarah Michaels: So we've kind of established that if they're identical twins which is pretty rare, they would have 100% so we know that the answer to the question is.

499
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:20.460
Sarah Michaels: My mother and child or father, and I can only have 50% so we know that the answer is yes, if they're twins but question is, what if they're two siblings like me and my sister we're not identical twins.

500
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:40.380
Sarah Michaels: But we look, you know we look a lot of like, is it possible that we could have more than 50% of our DNA I got some from my mom and she got the same I got some from my dad and he got the same she got the same from but we're not exactly alike, we didn't get everything the same.

501
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.040
Sarah Michaels: But is it possible that we have more than 50%.

502
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.420
Leandro Graterol: So you're saying that.

503
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.640
Leandro Graterol: Like you look different than your dad your sister yeah.

504
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:58.380
Sarah Michaels: taller we have slightly, but we look a lot alike, but little bit different lots of differences.

505
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.610
Jessica Zaleski: So what if I did this, what if I.

506
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:16.620
Jessica Zaleski: I took one day and to a and three be right in the sperm for my first sibling and.

507
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.450
Jessica Zaleski: i'm not copying just in the interest of time here.

508
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:40.860
Jessica Zaleski: What one be prime to be prime and three be prime from the mom Okay, and I put these together, and this was my first my first baby so i've got this one, first of all, who can tell us.

509
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.960
Jessica Zaleski: What will the gender of this child be.

510
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.890
Nhi Huynh: Male.

511
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.080
Jessica Zaleski: A male do you know.

512
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:56.850
salam: Because i'm the last tears there's one longer one and the other one is shorter.

513
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.300
Susan Snay: To get pretty much got that roll down.

514
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:16.680
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so I want someone to write someone who's got their notebook write this down we've got one a one be prime okay one a one B prime and a zoom in a little bit to a to be prime.

515
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:31.440
Jessica Zaleski: And then three A, and three a prime rather and three be alright, so those that's our that's our first sibling okay that down because we're going to compare it to another sibling yeah.

516
00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.060
Susan Snay: and see if they have.

517
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.010
Jessica Zaleski: More than if it's possible just using our random you know Okay, is it possible.

518
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:50.190
Jessica Zaleski: So one a one be prime to way to be prime three be three a prime all right now i'm gonna.

519
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:54.780
Jessica Zaleski: Just.

520
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.550
Jessica Zaleski: With these back okay.

521
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:10.920
So now now you're going to make two new gametes.

522
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.650
which are going to.

523
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:21.300
Susan Snay: fertilize and become a new zygote hair shows from Psalms with the original reverse diddling.

524
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.370
Jessica Zaleski: yeah now what did I have for the mother, the first time, what did I have for the PRIMES.

525
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:30.540
salam: What happened this.

526
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.730
Jessica Zaleski: What were the what were the PRIMES.

527
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.310
Jessica Zaleski: What I have from the mom.

528
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:36.900
salam: One B.

529
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.640
Jessica Zaleski: One V prime.

530
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.620
salam: And I remember.

531
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.430
salam: From the second one was.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.230
Jessica Zaleski: That anybody write it down.

533
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:47.730
Nhi Huynh: To be.

534
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.780
Jessica Zaleski: To be prime okay and.

535
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:53.340
Susan Snay: Then the last one.

536
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:54.840
salam: Is i'll be back.

537
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.610
Jessica Zaleski: Think I had three a prime right.

538
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.080
Jessica Zaleski: But what if I did that.

539
00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.930
Jessica Zaleski: Is it possible that I could get that mix.

540
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.000
Jessica Zaleski: Well yeah I mean it worked math of it, I mean.

541
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.770
Jessica Zaleski: I took one from each pair.

542
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.600
Jessica Zaleski: And then, if we put them together.

543
00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:30.000
Jessica Zaleski: I should have made a copy of those and put them below because we're not seeing a side by side comparison here of the same is it exactly the same.

544
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.610
Jessica Zaleski: Look at the first sibling what do we have the first time.

545
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.350
salam: Gender.

546
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.600
Jessica Zaleski: The same gender.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.340
Sarah Michaels: Did anybody ready down.

550
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:52.350
Sarah Michaels: What was the first one.

551
00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:58.440
Nhi Huynh: It was one a one B plan to a to be prime three prime and to be.

552
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.490
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, can you just i'm just going to type in a one a one B prime.

553
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.520
Nhi Huynh: To a to be prime.

554
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.070
Jessica Zaleski: To be prime.

555
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.170
Nhi Huynh: tweet a program.

556
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.060
Nhi Huynh: In TV.

557
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:26.850
Jessica Zaleski: Three B and three a prime yeah okay awesome so that was the first That was the first offspring okay So then, this one is one day.

558
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:28.560
Susan Snay: same as the other one.

559
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.820
Jessica Zaleski: One be prime.

560
00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:30.960
Susan Snay: same as the other one.

561
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:32.280
Jessica Zaleski: shoe a.

562
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.420
Susan Snay: same as the other one.

563
00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:37.200
Jessica Zaleski: To be prime.

564
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.430
Susan Snay: will damage the other one.

565
00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:40.320
Jessica Zaleski: And then.

566
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.670
Jessica Zaleski: Three be same.

567
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.460
Jessica Zaleski: And three be prime that one's the only one different.

568
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.660
Sarah Michaels: So they're not identical.

569
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.760
Jessica Zaleski: they're not identical, because.

570
00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:01.020
Sarah Michaels: But they have more than half of their DNA.

571
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:11.490
Susan Snay: So what would 50% of their DNA, how many of those chromosomes of the of the the three pairs how many of those chromosomes would be.

572
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.360
Jessica Zaleski: 50% 80%.

573
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.490
Which 50% of six.

574
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.220
Reggie: and

575
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:24.600
Jessica Zaleski: three.

576
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.440
Susan Snay: And how many do we have the same I just checked off more than three.

577
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.390
salam: We have.

578
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.060
Some chat for.

579
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:38.310
salam: The for the same and the last one is different in this.

580
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.720
Jessica Zaleski: Is a four.

581
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:55.140
Jessica Zaleski: And five high five yeah so three out of six would be 50% in common, which is the most they could share with their parent but we've got five out of six Now let me let's test it did I use the rules from yesterday to make these babies.

582
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:56.880
Nhi Huynh: Oh.

583
00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:59.070
Jessica Zaleski: Nikki saying no what did I not do.

584
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.830
salam: And you chose them, you know.

585
00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.980
Jessica Zaleski: that's true, I chose them but.

586
00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:05.820
Jessica Zaleski: It, what do you think.

587
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.740
Jessica Zaleski: If I sat here long enough, I could.

588
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:14.700
Jessica Zaleski: sit here for eight days and days and days and flip a coin eventually what I come up with that combination.

589
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:18.630
Leandro Graterol: Oh, like he can be.

590
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.310
Jessica Zaleski: Is a possible.

591
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:22.590
Susan Snay: question.

592
00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.240
Jessica Zaleski: Is it possible.

593
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.990
yeah.

594
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:31.920
Jessica Zaleski: I know it seems like I kind of cheated right because I chose, you know.

595
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.350
salam: In most possible.

596
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:45.990
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, I could probably sit here for the rest of my life with if we were talking 23 chromosomes I could sit here for the rest of my life flipping a coin, but is it possible that I could get these combinations.

597
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.400
Yes.

598
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.490
Yes.

salam: Right so follow the rules that.

600
00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:57.090
Jessica Zaleski: What I did I didn't exactly follow the rules, I kind of accelerated them.

601
00:52:57.390 --> 00:53:03.390
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly all right good job guys alright, I think we're going to go back to our baggies and.

Jessica Zaleski: Oh wow.

777
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:40.020
Ms. B: Very good.

778
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:48.240
Ms. B: And sometimes if it's taking a little longer to form, you can tilt it and just add a little bit more ice approval alcohol.

779
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.450
Leandro Graterol: I need to take a photo this is.

780
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.540
Sarah Michaels: Oh, that is so cool so.

781
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:00.690
Sarah Michaels: If the alcohols colder.

782
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.970
Ms. B: Is cold yeah if you put it in overnight.

783
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.740
Ms. B: Oh definitely.

784
01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:07.230
Susan Snay: No, I didn't do it tonight either no.

785
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:11.220
Ms. B: No, I didn't do it to mine, I was trying not to do the hacks.

786
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:15.870
Jessica Zaleski: Still miss the what are some reasons why it might not work so well.

787
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:23.520
Ms. B: um sometimes you can have more of a particular ingredient sometimes the DNA may not on coil.

788
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:32.730
Ms. B: If your proportions are right, so you want, if you put a certain amount of water versus soap powder, you want to make sure that you have equal amounts.

789
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:41.550
Ms. B: Sometimes there's not enough that that big word enzymatic activity, so it doesn't go as fast as you like it.

790
01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:47.700
Ms. B: One thing that people will do sometimes to speed it up is they'll put something like meat tender Iser or even.

791
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:59.670
Ms. B: pineapple juice because there's enzymes in it that speed up the process, so if you think yours is taking a long time, if you have meat tenderized or maybe you could sprinkle a little bit in it next time and see if it goes quicker.

792
01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.320
Jessica Zaleski: cool Thank you.

793
01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:06.300
Jessica Zaleski: i'm wondering if Maybe my proportions were off with my salt and my so.

794
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:18.270
Ms. B: No, for me, usually they say add like a third, a third of this a third of that teaspoon of salt, a third of water, and when you add a little bit too much like me i'm.

795
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:27.990
Ms. B: will say salt happy like when I cook and I added a little bit more than I needed to and my proportions weren't great I did get some but wasn't anything to.

796
01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:37.320
Sarah Michaels: Keep experimenting I mean I definitely think that the grapes didn't work, as well as the banana or the strawberry but.

797
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:51.000
Ms. B: As scientists, you can use different things, you can try dishwashing liquid, you can try dish detergent you can try powdered soaps liquid, so you can try a bunch of different things, and of course different fruits.

798
01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:52.440
Ms. B: Some people do.

799
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.330
Susan Snay: Also, oh my God.

800
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:55.590
Oh.

801
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.260
Jessica Zaleski: My word.

802
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:00.120
Ms. B: that's awesome.

803
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:00.930
Sarah Michaels: It looks like he.

804
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.570
Ms. B: knows what is yes, it looks like.

805
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.370
Ms. B: something that happens in the winter.

806
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:05.760
Time.

807
01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.390
Leandro Graterol: How do you get done much.

808
01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.410
Reggie: I broke my to strawberries and plumes of the bag and the Christie are.

809
01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:13.800
Like.

810
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:15.360
Jessica Zaleski: wow.

811
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.230
Ms. B: This.

812
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.070
Susan Snay: actually helps to break up the nucleus, which is.

813
01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:28.230
Susan Snay: Yes, today, so it allows it allows the Danny come out and that's the default actually helps to allow the DNA to stretch out is that right.

814
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:34.710
Ms. B: Yes, yep and bring something outside layer of the selling it stretches it out so it's not so coiled.

815
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:41.220
salam: I think mine didn't work cuz I added to them what this show so that's why it gets.

816
01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.380
Susan Snay: Good try it again, you got everything you need.

817
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:46.950
Jessica Zaleski: But I mean wow think about this for.

818
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:57.480
Jessica Zaleski: A second like i'm sitting here going okay miss be just explained that the soap helps to break down the nucleus this dish soap has the power to.

819
01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:11.250
Jessica Zaleski: break open the nucleus of the cells in this, and those are chemicals like think about the impact that chemicals can have on your body if it can do this, I mean that's really amazing.

820
01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:16.680
Jessica Zaleski: i'm extrapolating a lot here, but still I mean wow.

821
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.990
Jessica Zaleski: Why, you have to be careful what chemicals you use right.

822
01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:27.300
Susan Snay: i'm glad that most of us were very successful and those.

823
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.840
Susan Snay: are going to try and put it back in but.

824
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:39.270
Ms. B: If you let it sit for a little while you'll start to see the DNA pool at the top, you may not be able to pick it up, but you'll actually see the.

825
01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:40.110
Ms. B: DNA separating.

826
01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.120
Sarah Michaels: hold it up real quick hold it up.

827
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:50.070
Jessica Zaleski: There you very good here's a question I have raise your hand if you plan to try this again with a different fruit.

828
01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:53.100
Jessica Zaleski: Trying it again.

829
01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:53.700
well.

830
01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:56.610
Sarah Michaels: and

831
01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.240
Jessica Zaleski: it's a good thing it's vacation we can be doing this all week long at home.

832
01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:01.530
yeah.

833
01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:08.070
Sarah Michaels: People do different fruit keep photographs, so we can kind of share what we do.

834
01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:12.060
Susan Snay: give you that could be our extra class day we show our DNA puts.

835
01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:14.040
Jessica Zaleski: Put a picture in our Google classroom.

836
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:24.300
Jessica Zaleski: You can put a picture you know what i'm going to set an assignment for pictures of fruit DNA fruit extraction and you guys can upload pictures to it, as you do it.

837
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:27.840
Jessica Zaleski: Alright easiest way to get this, let me do that right now.

838
01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:32.340
Susan Snay: And then we can talk about we can look at what the results and see it isn't one fruit that's bad that good.

839
01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.290
Sarah Michaels: yeah yeah i'm definitely gonna try.

840
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.260
Susan Snay: I don't know yeah it's.

841
01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.280
salam: My Cup.

842
01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.380
salam: pigment in there.

843
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.130
salam: it's like one I.

844
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:46.200
salam: don't know.

845
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.700
Susan Snay: It almost looks like it didn't ship well, you have the tissues right.

846
01:09:52.410 --> 01:10:03.000
Susan Snay: I think you're gonna need like a good napkin or a face cloth something that you can strain all that the the material the cells out in only get the.

847
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.670
Ms. B: Lady can use one of these, one of these lovely little strangers.

848
01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:07.560
Sarah Michaels: Oh, really.

849
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.330
Ms. B: mm hmm okay.

850
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.710
Susan Snay: Fine, one.

851
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:15.330
Ms. B: she's cloth you can even use if you have God, you can use god's also.

852
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:16.950
Sarah Michaels: Quite.

853
01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:20.190
salam: A huge and I use too much.

854
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:30.390
Sarah Michaels: sodium less next time you guys think we should take a very short break and then come back i'm afraid that, for the next.

855
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:40.440
Sarah Michaels: For the thing we're going to do next, we might not have enough time and I don't want to rush exactly might take a little bit longer than an hour so let's just take a.

856
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:41.190
Jessica Zaleski: yeah what.

857
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:51.480
Jessica Zaleski: Why don't we just take like a three minute break get up quick move your legs grab a drink or something three minutes 57 let's come back right at one o'clock okay perfect.

858
01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.970
Jessica Zaleski: Sorry, Sarah and all the enthusiasm, I wasn't.

859
01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:08.010
Sarah Michaels: Keeping no no it's fine and you know it doesn't matter if we can we're going to play this by ear we're not necessarily going to have the time we need but we're gonna it's gonna be fine.

860
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:12.030
Reggie: It looks better on camera i'm looking at it.

861
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.970
Susan Snay: Oh yeah.

862
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.140
salam: That looks so cool.

863
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:25.290
Sarah Michaels: You know, I wonder if we should, if people who want to be connected would put their.

864
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:42.120
Sarah Michaels: Their cell phone number in the chat because then we can share photos and we can you know I don't know I just feel like since I can't be a part of the the Google classroom I would love to be able to like if I get it to work really well i'd love to be able to share a photo of.

865
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.580
Reggie: A monkey with a clear plastic like on bottle as MC one of these just putting some room somewhere.

866
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.580
Susan Snay: and say this is this is DNA.

867
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:57.990
Jessica Zaleski: And she said it looks like a lava lamp and she's exactly right, it really is.

868
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.160
Reggie: Effective he under this will arise good xyz.

869
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.050
Susan Snay: I don't know.

870
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.800
salam: I think the strawberries and bananas works, the best.

871
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:12.960
Susan Snay: yeah it doesn't look better so i'm going to upload my pictures to.

872
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.160
Reggie: wow yeah.

873
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.640
Sarah Michaels: yeah people should put pictures in the Google classroom.

874
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:24.030
Susan Snay: So we can you can enlarge the picture you can actually see the little bubbles that are on the strand of DNA.

875
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:24.960
Reggie: With these.

876
01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:29.400
Susan Snay: You could actually see look really closely they're actually strands.

877
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:35.760
Reggie: it's just as close as I could zoom in.

878
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.130
wow wow.

879
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:45.720
Susan Snay: Really cool pictures that you see yet people guess what it is.

880
01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.730
Reggie: i'm I do that miss.

881
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:53.910
Anisha Hassan: your friends might be like, are you holding your snob.

882
01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:58.920
Sarah Michaels: Oh.

883
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.330
Susan Snay: My husband was a difficult student with that activity Sarah I just want to tell you.

884
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.040
Susan Snay: he's one of those kids that you like really challenged by.

885
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:21.180
Susan Snay: Well, I want to know the way their language works, and we could not part of the way not supposed to do that.

886
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.750
Susan Snay: Mines floating now to reggie.

887
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.040
Susan Snay: actually coming out into the alcohol.

888
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.210
huh.

889
01:13:52.440 --> 01:14:05.640
Reggie: Yes, a nice job ease with the best because I think they're faster because nice came up late granted, we wonder why strawberries strawberries and bananas seems to work, the best, I wonder if it has to do with the amount of chromosomes.

890
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:14.100
Sarah Michaels: Well, what why don't we find out what strawberries have and what bananas have versus grapes grapes definitely was not as good.

891
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.700
Reggie: As my tribe group see how much I can get out of it.

892
01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.910
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so how many chromosomes and a strawberry.

893
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:22.920
Reggie: hey siri.

894
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.800
Reggie: xabi.

895
01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:33.120
Reggie: Nice to take some lumps Google the game so.

896
01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:36.600
Sarah Michaels: All right.

897
01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:38.880
Reggie: Just 56.

898
01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:42.960
Jessica Zaleski: that's what I found find look up banana.

899
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:45.330
Jessica Zaleski: Is a little surprised with banana.

900
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.620
Susan Snay: yeah.

901
01:14:58.050 --> 01:14:58.470
wow.

902
01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:04.950
Jessica Zaleski: Was that possible that have been Anna has a 11 chromosomes.

903
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:06.930
Sarah Michaels: It isn't possible.

904
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.380
Sarah Michaels: Maybe it's 11 pairs.

905
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:13.110
Jessica Zaleski: yeah it just said, this is the first yeah.

906
01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:18.450
Leandro Graterol: Man is my my cousins I reacted like, how do you do that.

907
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:18.990
Susan Snay: yeah.

908
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:28.200
Jessica Zaleski: you're right we under I just went out and told my family that tonight before we watch that we have family movie night we're doing a DNA fruit extraction lab they don't believe.

909
01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:37.680
Sarah Michaels: You know you guys I gotta tell you this when when I was first talking about creating this virtual science pod with people in the western public schools.

910
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:49.080
Sarah Michaels: We talked about the fact that, if we could do this, you guys could become sort of science ambassadors and you could do stuff with younger students, I could imagine you.

911
01:15:49.410 --> 01:16:05.820
Sarah Michaels: Doing this DNA extraction thing with younger kids and turning them on to biology in in the coolest way, so we can talk about the future, but I think it would be so cool if you guys could teach some of this to other people.

912
01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.730
Reggie: Like you might end up doing that today my little cousins are coming over.

913
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.990
wow.

914
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.140
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

915
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:14.670
Jessica Zaleski: on that.

916
01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:25.470
Sarah Michaels: The best way to learn to really learn something is to be able to teach it to someone else, so you guys know a lot it's it would be hard it's hard stuff it's complicated stuff but.

917
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:30.570
Susan Snay: Just just be careful, you don't pick up the wrong glass, I saw you drinking something guy.

918
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.130
Jessica Zaleski: I have to go for mine out because I was afraid I would.

919
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:35.760
accidentally.

920
01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:39.810
Susan Snay: Get rid of it.

921
01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.810
Sarah Michaels: that's not the way we want.

922
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:45.330
Susan Snay: Our last session, oh no.

923
01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:46.440
Sarah Michaels: All right, so.

1073
01:32:59.430 --> 01:33:03.600
Nhi Huynh: um I would prefer to go with one word instead of like a freeze.

1074
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:15.330
Sarah Michaels: that's a good point because the poet uses one word, and so, could you make a suggestion Nikki about what you would suggest, I love that response by the way, I think it's cool.

01:37:07.410 --> 01:37:11.970
Jessica Zaleski: One phrase oh by to what extent or.

1135
01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:21.360
Sarah Michaels: What do you guys think so we got to put this, all together, I asked earth earth lives with Earth.

1136
01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.090
Sarah Michaels: wow in what way.

1137
01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:30.720
Sarah Michaels: So that the word order you know in Vietnamese you might end with the verb we might.

1138
01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.060
Sarah Michaels: We might.

1139
01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.710
Sarah Michaels: Or you might put how, at the end, we might put how.

1140
01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.760
Sarah Michaels: Does earth live well anyway, something like this, I asked.

1141
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.800
salam: Her who's on the line.

1142
01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.410
Sarah Michaels: yeah earth lives with earth how.

1143
01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:50.550
Reggie: We miss yeah I think Okay, so you know it gives everything land right.

1144
01:37:50.730 --> 01:37:54.000
Reggie: yeah so will you be like how on earth lives with Lambda Lambda.

1145
01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:04.680
Sarah Michaels: Oh that's a good point, we could say how I asked her How does earth live with went yeah but the poet uses the same word, so I think.

1146
01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:09.030
Sarah Michaels: Maybe I don't know we should either stick with earth or land.

1147
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:12.120
Jessica Zaleski: Do you think that when we look at stands a.

1148
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:18.090
Jessica Zaleski: Two and see if there's any repetition there that might help us to clarify what we should use.

1149
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:19.560
Jessica Zaleski: yeah stanza one.

1150
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:24.930
Sarah Michaels: yeah yeah let's keep going a little bit longer so I asked her or land.

1151
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:34.680
Sarah Michaels: earth or land lives with earth or land How can anybody just get How would you if you wanted to make it sound more like English.

1152
01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:39.360
Nhi Huynh: One day, I will say how does or lupus or.

1153
01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:46.740
Sarah Michaels: Okay, all right so put that down as a I asked earth, how does earth live with Earth.

1154
01:38:50.400 --> 01:39:02.610
Sarah Michaels: Okay, so that, again, we can change this, we can all have different ideas about this, but that's the basic idea so let's look at the next john Tang oh boy don't tell now so Chung.

1155
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:04.290
Jessica Zaleski: or Chung.

1156

01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:20.400
Sarah Michaels: tongue cow.

1163
01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:28.230
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, we honor respect admire or revere whoo which.

1164
01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.450
Sarah Michaels: guys, what do you like there.

01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.570
Reggie: Are new respect I think those two okay.

Sarah Michaels: Are the spec we honor and then what's the last word now.

1168
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:44.130
Nhi Huynh: I didn't pronounce now yeah now you walk.

1169
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:46.260
Sarah Michaels: Together with.

1170
01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:47.790
salam: each other, each other.

1171
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.750
Sarah Michaels: We honor respect.

1172
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:53.100
together.

1173
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:59.580
Sarah Michaels: With each other, we honor respect who can just put it into together as a phrase.

1174
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:07.230
Sarah Michaels: Okay, we honor respect each other or we.

1175
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:20.190
Sarah Michaels: Respect yeah okay so that's the way you do it, you you use each word you think a little bit about maybe you look at the next word that you try to come up with some kind of.

1176
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:28.200
Sarah Michaels: Again this is phrase by phrase it's not perfect it's like a first draft of writing so we're going to send you guys.

1177
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:29.580
Anisha Hassan: Stop sharing.

1178
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.880
Sarah Michaels: into breakout rooms, with four people.

1179
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.000
Sarah Michaels: And what you're going to do together is translate.

1180
01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:51.780
Sarah Michaels: The rest of the poem the next two stanzas are sort of similar to this one, so that will be helpful, and then the last three somebody noticed are exactly the same.

1181
01:40:52.290 --> 01:41:01.860
Sarah Michaels: So there's not that much but it's going to take some back and forth and you're going to have to you know, do the best to agree with each other.

1182
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:16.440
Sarah Michaels: And then come up with a translation that you all kind of like so in the different groups will probably end up with slightly different doesn't matter just pick together.

1183
01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.550
Sarah Michaels: What you can do the best kind of.

1184
01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:33.690
Sarah Michaels: Translation you're capable of doing in your group and everyone's ideas count, so you might have to argue a little bit, but hopefully you could agree, you know.

1185
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:37.860
Sarah Michaels: And initially is there anything.

1186
01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:49.860
Anisha Hassan: So we so in the beginning, the teachers are not going to be in your group, so it is up to you and your ideas they'll kind of do the translation.

1187
01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:55.650
Anisha Hassan: So make sure to do them within yourself and discuss yeah.

1188
01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:15.750
Sarah Michaels: And I think for for people who speak Vietnamese you're an absolute resource and I think again it's a gift but don't just take over let let everyone, you know, have a chance to but but you're there and you're you have a gift, so you know it's great.

1189
01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:31.950
Sarah Michaels: And in the cases where some groups won't have the gift of a Vietnamese speaker then you're just have to do the very best you can to try to create a translation, that is worthy of this famous famous amazing poet.

1190
01:42:32.610 --> 01:42:36.150
Anisha Hassan: yeah and i'll just put you into breakout rooms and off you go.

1191
01:42:37.770 --> 01:42:42.570
Sarah Michaels: So we're going to give you guys about what did we say about 20 minutes.

1192
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:43.020
hmm.

1193
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:49.560
Susan Snay: So we're going to ask them to type into their own document, the same way that in nisha was doing.

1194
01:42:49.710 --> 01:42:56.940
Sarah Michaels: yeah one person can type can type for the group, however, they want to do it, they can share.

1195
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.480
Sarah Michaels: So we've got n G and norris still D.

1196
01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:10.650
Anisha Hassan: i'm Nora you should have gotten an invitation.

1197
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:19.860
Anisha Hassan: And Andy I just put your other you your your other self yeah okay yeah now you have invitation for both.

1198
01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:35.790
Sarah Michaels: So i'm one possibility, initially, is that you visit each group and just tell them that one person, maybe.

1199
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:36.840
Sarah Michaels: could share.

1200
01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:38.730
Sarah Michaels: And do the typing.

1201
01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:47.280
Anisha Hassan: yeah, let me just do that, and when do you like, we can give them about 10 minutes and then go into the groups.

1202
01:43:47.370 --> 01:43:49.920
Anisha Hassan: And we only have about 30 minutes in total.

1203
01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:50.970
Anisha Hassan: So yeah.

1204
01:43:51.510 --> 01:44:00.360
Jessica Zaleski: And we do need to explain to them like how we're going to get the gift card and the feedback and all that to them, so we just got to reserve a few minutes for that.

1205
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:05.400
Sarah Michaels: yeah I think basically we'll see what they can do in 10 minutes.

1206
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.770
Sarah Michaels: And we'll see how far they get.

1207
01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:11.280
Sarah Michaels: and

1208
01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:13.980
Sarah Michaels: You know that.

1209
01:44:18.090 --> 01:44:28.500
Sarah Michaels: we're not doing it, the exactly the normal way, but each group I think there's a lot of good stuff in these kids I mean, I think the way they handled.

1210
01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:37.080
Sarah Michaels: The beginning part they heard a lot of different ideas, and I have a lot of confidence that there but anyway we'll say.

1211
01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:40.410
Anisha Hassan: Okay i'll Go and tell them the instructions.

1212
01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:42.180
Sarah Michaels: We.

1213
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:45.900
Sarah Michaels: We group them carefully so that.

1214
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:49.650
Sarah Michaels: We actually put the very talkative ones.

1215
01:44:50.700 --> 01:45:01.050
Sarah Michaels: Together, so that the quiet ones are together and they're going to have to problem they're going to have to struggle through it a little bit.

1216
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:10.590
Sarah Michaels: But we'll see have you guys you've got one actually argue yeah yeah hopefully.

1217
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:25.920
Jessica Zaleski: that's such a cool activity what's amazing to me is how to see, and I mean, I see this a lot in esl class like the the native Spanish speakers reaction to the Vietnamese speakers.

1218
01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:26.610
Jessica Zaleski: You know.

1219
01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:29.010
Jessica Zaleski: Any tonal language they're just blown away.

1220
01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:38.760
Jessica Zaleski: And it's like well you know it's that they don't understand that that's reciprocal that you know what I mean Spanish sounds to the Vietnamese.

1221
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:39.750
Sarah Michaels: ear oh.

1222
01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:59.550
Jessica Zaleski: Very strange, you know and the Vietnamese students tend to never express that, as you know, openly it's just so interesting, so I it's so precious when they ask each other how to say I mean this is like one of the things I love the most about he is teaching esl.

1223
01:46:00.210 --> 01:46:01.920
Jessica Zaleski: Having this community that they.

1224
01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:08.880
Jessica Zaleski: want to learn about from each other, but that just that it's in the pronunciation oh yeah.

1225
01:46:08.970 --> 01:46:13.590
Susan Snay: yeah what that is so cute that he wants to tell his friend hello, in his own language yeah.

1226
01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:21.840
Jessica Zaleski: yeah yeah it's just the idea that you know, they say, like Oh, this is so hard to translate and it's like well.

1227
01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:33.540
Jessica Zaleski: you're doing this, all the time with English, you know what I mean so many of them as they were learning are using are figuring this out they're not even thinking about it, you know but they're going through.

1228
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:46.950
Sarah Michaels: I mean really what a rich group and the fact that we have those two yeah and there was a sense, you could just feel the pride, you know beautiful yeah it was it was.

1249
01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.510
Ms. B: yeah he was there for the first hour and then he says he he's at the airport, I think you probably.

1251
01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:35.190

yeah.

1255
01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:41.100
Sarah Michaels: It was so vivid.

1256
01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:47.790
Sarah Michaels: That you could see what other people were doing, and you would just wish you, you could do it, but yeah we got moment right.

1257
01:48:48.210 --> 01:48:51.960
Ms. B: Did you check your screenshot, I think, is what his picture be in there if he was doing it.

1262
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.420
Anisha Hassan: wow oh my gosh I don't think that's allowed but.

1263
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:04.770
Anisha Hassan: All of them were sharing.

1264
01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:18.090
Anisha Hassan: These one of them were sharing their screen and angie was able to open the link with another email address like gmail but not there, Mr I don't know what was wrong with that.

1265
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:20.790
Ms. B: yeah I had the same thing when I tried to open it with.

1266
01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:24.660
Ms. B: The worcester public schools it didn't open, but what my gmail it open for some reason.

1267
01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:27.750
Ms. B: And it was the second link, not the first link yeah.

1268
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:39.330
Anisha Hassan: I today I couldn't even share the survey with the Western schools like emails I was like i'll just send them the link and, hopefully, they can open I don't know why that was happening.

1269
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.770
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1270
01:49:41.850 --> 01:49:42.330
Sarah Michaels: i'm.

1271
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:52.020
Sarah Michaels: To some extent anyway we'll see so How long have they been in there, but six minutes six minutes yeah let's give them.

1272
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.800
Sarah Michaels: Did you glean anything from when you went in yeah.

1273
01:49:56.070 --> 01:50:01.620
Anisha Hassan: So reggie's group was like sharing their screen, there were talking about it i'm like okay you've got this.

1274
01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:15.000
Anisha Hassan: workout was sharing the screen, because nobody else could do like share yeah then angie Salaam and Nora they all have their cameras off, but they were talking like they were responding like.

1275
01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.920
Anisha Hassan: And then almost group, they were also working towards it.

1276
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:29.070
Anisha Hassan: will see how much they get done without any super supervision or well The good news is is once they.

1277
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:31.170
Susan Snay: get down to the last three lines.

1278
01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:38.580
Anisha Hassan: it's just wanting it's the same thing um yeah all my raquel and I, we did it in like 15 minutes but.

1279
01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:41.580
Anisha Hassan: Your grown ups yeah.

1280
01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:52.050
Sarah Michaels: yeah but that you know that yeah I think if they it's it's a relatively easy just word by word and some of the words are doubles and.

1281
01:50:52.650 --> 01:50:54.600
Susan Snay: Nikki and me are both in separate groups.

1282
01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:55.530
Anisha Hassan: Yes, yes.

1283
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:57.300
Susan Snay: So that's going to make a big.

1284
01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.220
Sarah Michaels: that's right so two groups would have a lot.

1285
01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:00.540
Susan Snay: yeah.

1286
01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.800
Sarah Michaels: I think that will be.

1287
01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.350
Sarah Michaels: yeah so um.

1288
01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:12.990
Sarah Michaels: let's see so let's think about what we're going to do at the end we'll have a little discussion.

1289
01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:20.790
Sarah Michaels: Hopefully it will come back to living things and harmony, or you know that it's all.

1290
01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.620
Susan Snay: And we're all interconnected.

1291
01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:30.210
Sarah Michaels: And that people sometimes there isn't a good answer, sometimes for how does, how did people live with people.

1292
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.860
Sarah Michaels: But this group certainly as a group that.

1293
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:46.530
Sarah Michaels: You know works together harmonize is the specs it's really cool it's been to such a sweet sweet thing.

1294
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:52.980
Sarah Michaels: I thought today was really not the poem stuff so much, but the other stuff is so cool.

1295
01:51:54.630 --> 01:51:59.400
Sarah Michaels: So we're going to tell them about the gift cards and.

1296
01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:06.390
Sarah Michaels: The and the survey that they have to do before they get get their gift card.

1297
01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:18.510
Jessica Zaleski: No i'm just just in the interest of time I just went in and you guys all have access to the attendance sheet, I was kind of tabulating based on their attendance and stuff what their gift card amount should be.

1298
01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:29.850
Jessica Zaleski: And we can discuss it, but like I didn't write my rationale for everything, but I think it's pretty clear um and then I think we can Sue and I were talking before this that if we say.

1299
01:52:30.630 --> 01:52:39.630
Jessica Zaleski: You will be contacted by Miss nay or Mrs laskey in the next two weeks to arrange for drop off of your gift card.

1300
01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:47.040
Jessica Zaleski: But before we can drop off your gift card, we need to have received the survey back from you so you're going to get a survey in the next few days.

1301
01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:59.790
Jessica Zaleski: And you need to complete that survey and then we can schedule the time to drop off your gift card, and when we drop off the gift card, you have to be there because you need to sign a form to say you received the gift card.

1302
01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:02.370
Anisha Hassan: i'm supposed to the survey be anonymous or not.

1303
01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:04.740
Sarah Michaels: Now I think not anonymous.

1304
01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.350
Anisha Hassan: just put in the name yeah.

1305
01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.300
Sarah Michaels: um the.

1306
01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:21.300
Sarah Michaels: The thing about the survey is it's not a test we really want to know how they felt about this experience and how you know.

1307
01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:24.810
Susan Snay: So yeah that that are really no.

1308
01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:29.880
Sarah Michaels: there's no there's no right or wrong answers, but we really care about their thinking.

1309
01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:37.740
Sarah Michaels: And we want them to answer it as fully as they can and it's not completely honestly yeah.

1310
01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:42.120
Anisha Hassan: So it's been 10 Minutes do you guys want to go into different rooms oh.

Sarah Michaels: And I hope you take it forward, in other words the kindness, the helpfulness and respect, I hope you share that you know you take you carry that from the virtual science pod to your classes to other things you do so that you're always, in a sense, carrying us with you.

1523
02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:49.170
Sarah Michaels: Any other last comments.

Sarah Michaels: And we could not have done it without the three Clark undergraduate.

1576
02:23:56.730 --> 02:24:02.370
Sarah Michaels: And then, to say something I was just so shaken up at the end, but I meant to say something that.

1577
02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:16.800
Sarah Michaels: You know that we want them to know that they're connected to Clark, and to Clark undergraduates and they make you know what will will I mean will be able to keep in touch with them well, we will seriously.

Ms. B: i'm kinda yeah so I could definitely do that yeah.

1583
02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:55.500
Sarah Michaels: It is Nikki at Western tech or she.

1584
02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.610
Ms. B: nikki's from north.

1585
02:24:56.640 --> 02:24:57.960

1586
02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:58.320
Jessica Zaleski: That would.

1587
02:24:58.350 --> 02:25:03.990
Sarah Michaels: Okay, she was just such a such a beautiful.

Sarah Michaels: Such a and.

1589
02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:23.400
Ms. B: yeah and when I had her and she was she was a level one we had to do a lot of labs one to one after school because the translation and she was so nervous in class because she was the only Vietnamese student and when we read aloud so she's come such a long way.

1590
02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:26.790
Just it's just.

1591
02:25:27.930 --> 02:25:34.680
Ms. B: You know, it was nice to see the evolution of each of them and raquel for Kathleen she find it she she kept her camera on so i'm sure.

1592
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:37.740
Ms. B: i'm sure that encouragement and having.

1593
02:25:37.890 --> 02:25:45.960
Ms. B: support and making her feel comfortable and safe definitely contributed to that because that was like evolution that was like oh my gosh she's.

1594
02:25:47.730 --> 02:25:51.390
Raquel Fernandes: incredible how she messaged me every class about something and.

1595
02:25:52.770 --> 02:25:55.140
Raquel Fernandes: I made sure to she has my phone number and my.

1596
02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:56.490
Jessica Zaleski: email, and she needs to come to see.

1597
02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:58.050
Thank you.

1598
02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:10.680
Jessica Zaleski: wow you know I didn't I don't know that we mentioned this, but I can tell you probably remember coming into the class one time and helping wow in a group.

1599
02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:17.460
Jessica Zaleski: He, unfortunately, is still disengaged and we've met with his dad and tried to do everything we can, and he's struggling.

1600
02:26:17.850 --> 02:26:30.030
Jessica Zaleski: A Catherine has started reaching out to him in the chat during class and asking him if he understands in Portuguese and like this is what I need about the leadership that we are seeing.

1601
02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:43.080
Jessica Zaleski: Even Kevin who may have felt the most insecure in this group linguistically is now trying to build that bridge of comprehension for other students and doing fresh wow what you are doing for her, and you have.

1602
02:26:43.530 --> 02:26:49.110
Jessica Zaleski: That so beautifully so thank you minds me of trying to rescue somebody that's drowning.

1603
02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:57.570
Susan Snay: tossing them a lifesaver and that's what she reminds me of when she is typing things in there, she wants to save him and bring him back in yeah folder I don't know.

1604
02:26:58.650 --> 02:26:59.430
yeah it's beautiful.

1605
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:09.660
Ms. B: And I think we Andrew elman loved having the support there, so he could go back and forth he could go English, Spanish either or.

1606
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:11.460
Sarah Michaels: Yes, that was interesting.

1607
02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:21.540
Jessica Zaleski: I appreciate that so much because I see you know Leandro as a student who really wants to wrestle through the English and figure it out.

1608
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:29.250
Jessica Zaleski: But they're just as a point where I you know where whether it's in biology class or in like his other classes that i've observed him and I can hear.

1609
02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:49.440
Jessica Zaleski: there's a wall, you know, and I know he has so much more to say and so just having the ability to be free about that and go beyond where his English concurrently take him and fully express what he's thinking that's just such a wonderful opportunity, so thank you so much.

1610
02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.290
Ms. B: I want to thank you and nisha the master of ceremonies.

1611
02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:01.830
Sarah Michaels: And you know with Sylvia who she didn't have a partner.

1612
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:16.650
Sarah Michaels: undergraduate who speaks Albanian or whatever, but I felt like she also I mean I felt like she was she she appreciated it and she was anyway it's interesting what kind of support.

1613
02:28:17.490 --> 02:28:33.960
Sarah Michaels: really makes a huge difference, but I just felt like all of them, you know even you know know Nora anyway, I felt like all of them even Julie, I don't know i'm not as down on her as her was but we'll have to have to.

1614
02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:46.230
Ms. B: it's she she gave what she was willing to give, but when she was willing to give it was good, but she just didn't always give enough if that makes sense.

1615
02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:59.490
Sarah Michaels: I did private email her a bunch of times, but once I said, you know it's really important, we want to see your face, so we can feel you here, and she wrote back and said.

1616
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:11.580
Sarah Michaels: I, I understand that I have such anxiety, but I really do understand and she said i'm trying trying anyway, she she just somehow I don't know.

1617
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:18.510
Ms. B: But at least she acknowledged it, I mean that's the first step, I mean some people take a year to get past step two, so I mean.

1618
02:29:18.810 --> 02:29:19.920
Sarah Michaels: We don't know that's another.

1619
02:29:20.010 --> 02:29:21.060
Ms. B: yeah she tried.

1620
02:29:21.090 --> 02:29:22.500
Sarah Michaels: For a yeah we don't know.

1621
02:29:22.590 --> 02:29:24.210
Ms. B: definitely try that least.

1622
02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:27.870
Sarah Michaels: But i'm curious how she yeah she felt.

1623
02:29:28.140 --> 02:29:32.970
Ms. B: Hopefully this will make her be a little bit more brave as time progresses.

1624
02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:34.620
Sarah Michaels: She says somebody mentioned, I.

1625
02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:41.640
Sarah Michaels: Salaam that I feel brave that something that this group is brave and something that is so cool.

1626
02:29:44.730 --> 02:29:51.540
Sarah Michaels: And you know the with the science, with the learning, it was interesting have that last conversation about parents versus siblings.

1627
02:29:52.080 --> 02:30:09.750
Sarah Michaels: How they really struggled with it, they had differences, but I could feel that the group came to see something it just struck me that they really were thinking and they learned, you know and certain things and now oh yeah we have 23 chromosomes.

1628
02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:11.370
Jessica Zaleski: The progress is.

1629
02:30:11.430 --> 02:30:12.060
Sarah Michaels: amazing.

1630
02:30:12.090 --> 02:30:20.610
Jessica Zaleski: it's great think of where we were three sessions ago with them to where we got last night, I honestly like I.

1631
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.960
Jessica Zaleski: Think.

1632
02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:23.670
Ms. B: Because I really yes definitely.

1633
02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:24.840
Jessica Zaleski: Less than.

1634
02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:31.830
Ms. B: The I don't knows and much more assertiveness absolutely like nope that's not what no I mean no.

1635
02:30:33.570 --> 02:30:37.170
Jessica Zaleski: The fact that they were all over me because I did not follow the rules.

1636
02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:38.100
Ms. B: No rules.

1637
02:30:41.370 --> 02:30:49.770
Jessica Zaleski: No, so that just shows that they have taken ownership of those rules and they do know them and they can apply that which is the whole point.

1638
02:30:51.210 --> 02:30:51.660
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

1639
02:30:52.770 --> 02:30:55.770
Sarah Michaels: Anyway, well, we should all go and.

1640
02:30:56.100 --> 02:31:02.100
Anisha Hassan: yeah i'm just here's the food, you can upload it now, if you want, or if you can look at it.

1641
02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:05.400
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, yep do I have added my collaborator on it.

1642
02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:07.710
Anisha Hassan: we'd, let me just add you guys as a collaborator.

1643
02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:09.390
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so much easier.

1644
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:19.680
Sarah Michaels: Anyway, I just can't tell you how happy this that we that we all did it together anyway i'm just incredibly grateful.

1645
02:31:20.430 --> 02:31:29.820
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you for I mean, thank you, Sarah because you're really you were the driving force behind this I mean you are a force to be reckoned with and I appreciate.

1646
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:37.860
Jessica Zaleski: Your diligence and honestly it's your enthusiasm, I mean I I said to sue Sarah could sell ice to an eskimo.

1647
02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:41.610
Jessica Zaleski: You it but it's not it's in such.

1648
02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:43.470
Jessica Zaleski: an authentic way.

1649
02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:44.910
Jessica Zaleski: to happen.

1650
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:59.940
Sarah Michaels: If this all happened I swear to you, there was one conversation where you had where you said short of selling our organs to them, we don't know what to do, and I remember that time, where I said, we have to.

1651
02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:15.480
Sarah Michaels: try something I mean it was not, it was not something I even wanted to do, or whatever, but it was like we were all feeling, this is just in that that we changed anything but that we know anyway.

1652
02:32:15.570 --> 02:32:17.370
Jessica Zaleski: I just thought we did change things.

1653
02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:18.720
Jessica Zaleski: We did change things.

1654
02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:20.790
Jessica Zaleski: And I believe it, I mean.

1655
02:32:20.970 --> 02:32:23.610
Susan Snay: and think about all of these kids that are going to go and change.

1656
02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:24.660
Sarah Michaels: Other people they already.

1657
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:27.360
Susan Snay: Shared what they learned with their families.

1658
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:28.230
Sarah Michaels: Yes.

1659
02:32:28.290 --> 02:32:29.520
The teachers, causing.

1660
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:33.540
Susan Snay: The group that we have here, this is.

1661
02:32:35.250 --> 02:32:36.300
Ms. B: Like you never want to think.

1662
02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:43.740
Ms. B: About tests and stuff, but the fact that they're like Oh, some of these kids may have to take the test two years from now, but these are the concepts that for most of them.

1663
02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:53.190
Ms. B: Take the entire year to cover and they still don't understand it, and I think they have it like it's going to be in eight at that point so it's going to make things.

1664
02:32:53.730 --> 02:33:05.760
Ms. B: A little easier to to navigate so it's it's huge and hopefully they'll tell their friends like after school science camp or science pods are not bad they're actually fun yeah.

1665
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:07.440
Jessica Zaleski: And the confidence that I think.

1666
02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:17.520
Jessica Zaleski: I think of when we asked them about how did they feel when they were called out on things that some of them, it made them hate math or whatever it was because they felt insecure.

1667
02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:30.210
Jessica Zaleski: I don't think any of them feel insecure in a science class at this point, you know I think they all know, like I I can be the leader in the science class now it's true it's really interesting.

1668
02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:44.760
Ms. B: notice even Salaam started to think before she spoke, rather than just blurting, the first thing that came in and then just building watching them build up the pieces so scaffolding, they were doing it on their own like it was it was great to see.

1669
02:33:46.170 --> 02:33:56.610
Jessica Zaleski: We just don't know the impact that this will have on their futures and how they view themselves as learners more is that they may have just closed on themselves.

1670
02:33:57.060 --> 02:34:06.360
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, I think it's I think it's amazing, you know that they absolutely and and then having again a nisha and Alma and a cow here as.

1671
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:23.070
Jessica Zaleski: Representatives of Okay, you are all multi lingual you are in college or have graduated from college you're successful you're involved in science, even if it's through this you know what I mean like that is such a great model for them to see it's wonderful.

1672
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:26.730
Susan Snay: To show the communities important yeah you know.

1673
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:42.630
Sarah Michaels: Like he said, its unity, we have to work together, oh that was so amazing he you know he he wanted to speak, he raised his hand and he said no, and then he said this class is unity so yeah.

1674
02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:51.360
Jessica Zaleski: I mean what an array of abilities and backgrounds, and I mean it just is such a cool thing and.

1675
02:34:51.930 --> 02:35:02.670
Jessica Zaleski: your patience with key Sean and giving him the opportunity to I i'm sure his mother is so tremendous I know she appreciates it.

1676
02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:11.160
Ms. B: yeah because I know she didn't say it in the in the in the chat one, so you know, thank you for the patients and stuff like that yeah I mean yeah cuz I mean he's a brilliant young man.

1677
02:35:11.550 --> 02:35:13.710
Jessica Zaleski: he's time to process absolutely yeah.

1678
02:35:15.210 --> 02:35:16.950
Ms. B: Very good, well Thank you everyone thank.

1679
02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:17.700
Ms. B: You for.

1680
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:18.960
Ms. B: for inviting me.

1681
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:20.280
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you for your help.

1682
02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:21.960
Ms. B: Thank you for inviting me.

1683
02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:25.170
Sarah Michaels: Oh i'm dish on it.

1684
02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:27.930
Ms. B: I wish I could have done more, but thank you, I appreciate it.

1685
02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:30.000
Ms. B: No, and now at least I finally get.

1686
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.130
Ms. B: to actually get a taste of true ember.

1687
02:35:32.430 --> 02:35:35.250
Ms. B: yeah finally virtual ember.

1688
02:35:35.730 --> 02:35:36.270
Right.

1689
02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:49.710
Ms. B: But if, if you think of it if it had this much of an impact in a virtual setting like I can fathom what it does in the classroom yeah so I mean it just encourages me more so thank you.

1690
02:35:50.010 --> 02:35:51.360
Sarah Michaels: We should think about.

1691
02:35:52.620 --> 02:36:12.930
Sarah Michaels: How we can tell a little story about this, so that we can go back to sue o'neill and Carmen melendez and just to you know how did this and and raquel i'm wondering if we could make a little montage at the end comments of that from the students, that would be.

1692
02:36:12.990 --> 02:36:14.760
Ms. B: I mean, it would have been nice if you could have done it like.

1693
02:36:15.060 --> 02:36:25.620
Ms. B: In the Google classroom where there was just like segments of each of them, giving their feedback so it's just like one after the next you talk about the program and then like the screenshots come in, have the kids given their feedback.

1694
02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:29.070
Ms. B: yeah we are in the digital literacy rate.

1695
02:36:29.250 --> 02:36:42.000
Anisha Hassan: yeah go on zoom it takes multiple views, so we do the speaker view as well, and we, I think we're account will be able to create a montage if she uses her external hard drive is a big.

1696
02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:45.840
Ms. B: flip grid.

1697
02:36:46.470 --> 02:36:51.150
Sarah Michaels: About think about it right cal what what you could imagine a little short.

1698
02:36:52.290 --> 02:36:58.860
Sarah Michaels: Virtual science pod some video of I think it'd be powerful to hear the students voice.

1699
02:36:58.890 --> 02:37:02.220
Ms. B: yeah the students voices are going to make that biggest impact to.

1700
02:37:02.850 --> 02:37:13.740
Ms. B: hear them too much say that they actually like anything relative to school or academics and just actually they're doing this outside of the normal business hours on the weekends and they still.

1701
02:37:14.190 --> 02:37:21.180
Ms. B: It was impactful they felt unity and they enjoyed it and they learned so much, and they are brave now, so I mean.

1702
02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:22.410
yeah.

1703
02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:36.690
Sarah Michaels: I think that there were there are a few places where they are actually talking science they're trying they're struggling, I think it would be interesting if we had a little bit of that as well, anyway, we can think about this.

1704
02:37:38.310 --> 02:37:39.150
Moving on, but.

1705
02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:42.810
Sarah Michaels: wow what a happy happy thing.

1706
02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:45.900
Ms. B: Well, have a wonderful break everyone be safe.

1707
02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:47.310
Sarah Michaels: Oh yeah.

1708
02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:51.600
Ms. B: And I hope when you guys get back to school, you get to see more faces.

1709
02:37:53.490 --> 02:37:53.850
Sarah Michaels: yeah that's.

1710
02:37:53.940 --> 02:38:05.580
Sarah Michaels: going to be hard, it will have to keep you know we'll have to keep talking and thinking about, and if there are things that that the learning lab folks can do to support that that's going to be tricky.

1711
02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:09.720
Thank you everyone.

1712
02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:11.370
Jessica Zaleski: Good.

1713
02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:13.680
Anisha Hassan: Day.

1714
02:38:14.850 --> 02:38:16.590
Jessica Zaleski: All right, thanks take care.
