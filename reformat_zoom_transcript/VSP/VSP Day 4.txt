Susan Snay: Normal Saturdays in person, but this was the first zoom one so it's.

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.040
Susan Snay: Challenging by yourself.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.150
Sarah Michaels: How did it go.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:31.230
Susan Snay: I it wasn't a complete failure, so I guess the thing that's good you know I told them right from the beginning i'm like look it's not a format that i'm familiar with, please be patient with me, you know, I appreciate your patience, I said and anybody has any suggestions I am open to them.

6
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:54.570
Sarah Michaels: So later today i'm going to do, do my first vu zoom classroom with breakout rooms so i'm i'm you know, everybody else that Clark is familiar but i'm not so i'm going to be in exactly the same employee channeling you yeah i'm not doing this, if you, you know more than I do, definitely.

7
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:06.270
Susan Snay: And I looked up videos I watched as much as I could I tested the links by sending them to my husband thinking, you know that i'd be able to work through all the problems, but no whatever right.

8
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:19.590
Anisha Hassan: stuff like yeah yeah I see students don't like as soon as we We understand that it's hard, and this is all very new and challenging yeah.

9
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.420
Sarah Michaels: yeah yeah.

10
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.370
Susan Snay: yeah I think everybody's learning patience this year yeah.

11
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.190
Sarah Michaels: People are giving each other grace and that's true.

12
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.700
Anisha Hassan: yeah I remember in one of my classes.

13
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:43.710
Anisha Hassan: For some reason the Professor couldn't share her screen and we didn't have our class slides but we just rolled with it, and she just talked to the entire way through.

14
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.400
Sarah Michaels: And all things that can go wrong.

15
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.870
yeah.

16
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.570
Sarah Michaels: Well it's it's good you're.

17
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:07.680
Sarah Michaels: So just you know are learning zoom and getting more comfortable with it, that that will maybe that will be helpful for other things, and you should maybe you can answer this one.

18
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.800
Susan Snay: For the breakout sessions in zoom, this is not the same for me, have to set it up at the beginning, like before you even start the meeting or can you change it midway.

19
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:29.790
Anisha Hassan: You can change it midway that's what I was struggling with so you can change it anytime but as soon as all the people are in you can start making the group that's what I do because it does take a while to make the group.

20
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.930
Susan Snay: If you pick them right.

21
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:47.190
Anisha Hassan: yeah if you pick him, so I just tried to do it as soon as everyone's here so it's not liking, this will show up in my in my little menu that choice to do that okay Okay, so if you are.

22
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.660
Sarah Michaels: You share your screen.

23
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.140
Anisha Hassan: Oh yeah maybe that could work.

24
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.500
Sarah Michaels: Is that I have them on my screen, are you probably.

25
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:07.920
Anisha Hassan: This is not because of the attendance sheet I don't think you can see my screen, let me take a screenshot of my screen and you can see it actually.

26
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.600
Sarah Michaels: I need to laugh you.

27
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:23.070
Sarah Michaels: could just point to that, but so so at the very bottom of your screen you see security participants chat share screen, so I also see breakout rooms.

28
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.690
Susan Snay: Oh, I don't have that as a choice.

29
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:38.550
Sarah Michaels: But you will if you're the host that's weird because I hosted this last this meeting with these kids this morning and I didn't have that as an option so maybe I didn't set it up right right so did you go when you opened up your zoom today.

30
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:47.160
Sarah Michaels: Did you go through the link that you send everyone or did you go through the brat your your your own zoom meetings.

31
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.530
Susan Snay: I actually have to do to because it wasn't showing up right and I was panicking so I had like two of them open so maybe I opened the wrong one so i'm going to play with that again.

32
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:07.290
Sarah Michaels: Yes, because, like, I see breakout rooms and so that's it it's got a little set of four boxes and it says under a breakout rooms and then, when I click on it, it says, create.

33
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:26.100
Sarah Michaels: And you can put as many rooms, as you want 234 and it says, you have the choice to assign automatically or assign manually or let participants choose rooms so initial What do you say assign manually or what What do you do us.

34
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.720
Anisha Hassan: The fastest way if I do it a fine.

35
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.420
Okay.

36
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.420
Anisha Hassan: um I just assigned automatically, then I change them.

37
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.930
Okay.

38
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.270
Sarah Michaels: So what do you guys make a decision that usually has some.

39
00:04:45.690 --> 00:05:00.720
Susan Snay: She will she's the one that just was talking about that was really you know the one with a Chihuahua a picture that we had never camera on and took the bag, without any emotion whatsoever, so I think this is just for kids to bail, which is terrible you know but.

40
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.690
Jessica Zaleski: i'm not gonna beggar to continue.

41
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.160
Jessica Zaleski: i'm not I just.

42
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:14.490
Jessica Zaleski: You know she was reticent, to begin with, and I don't feel like she ever I don't feel like her, investment in it was really building so.

43
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:25.470
Jessica Zaleski: um and I wouldn't want anybody to feel trapped in anything you know so like she she it was very responsible of her to attack and say that, and not just not show up.

44
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:37.740
Jessica Zaleski: She wanted to know she needed to return the package and I said absolutely no you don't need to return the package you can keep it so yeah that's excellent also sent I don't know if you saw the email that Kathleen sent.

45
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.260
Susan Snay: I, it was in Portuguese so.

46
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.850
Jessica Zaleski: I oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

47
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.400
Susan Snay: back and asked another question back and Portuguese I don't know if I answered so right but I tried, she said something about not being able to come, but it was like.

48
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.780
Jessica Zaleski: I think she got bumped out and then couldn't get back in.

49
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.740
Susan Snay: Oh OK.

50
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:06.120
Jessica Zaleski: I think that's what she was saying, if hold on one second i'm going to just put what she wrote in the chat here in Portuguese and rock Gal can tell us.

51
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.130
Susan Snay: Although I wasn't sure if she meant this this session that she was going to ask or.

52
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.100
Jessica Zaleski: I can't get back into the room, I think right.

53
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.530
Raquel Fernandes: yeah she's saying that she can't get back into to.

54
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.470
Anisha Hassan: tie nura mikey Sean.

55
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.260
Jessica Zaleski: Like to shine Hello morning but it's actually good afternoon i'm in three minutes.

56
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.670
Anisha Hassan: yeah we have.

57
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.200
Sarah Michaels: Why are you both for you Sean.

58
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.220
Susan Snay: Put everybody up on the gallery, at the same time.

59
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.820
yeah.

60
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.760
Anisha Hassan: Do you have the gallery view setup right now I do but it'll only let so many on there and then I have the.

61
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.230
Susan Snay: arrow that you have to kind of scroll.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.190
yeah.

63
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.960
Okay.

64
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:19.560
Anisha Hassan: um I think it just depends on the size of your screen, because sometimes like if i'm using my phone I only have four people in the even if i'm on gallery view I have four people on the screen.

65
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:28.110
Anisha Hassan: But on my laptop I can see up to 16 or 20 people Oh, maybe i'll put it i'll see if I can slide it over to that on the screen.

66
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.360
Sarah Michaels: yeah you slide it over you'll see more.

67
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.310
Sarah Michaels: So you guys each have two screens that you can look at.

68
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.960
Susan Snay: yeah that's why a lot of times you'll see me looking.

69
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.590
Sarah Michaels: yeah me too, looking at the other screen I know.

70
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.220
Sarah Michaels: I know it's.

71
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.900
Sarah Michaels: weird that that's helpful if you can figure it out and all that still.

72
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.010
Susan Snay: I mess it up all the time.

73
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.000
Sarah Michaels: yeah yep.

74
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.910
Susan Snay: Something over to that screen and i'm scrolling to the wrong side.

75
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.770
Anisha Hassan: yeah so like two monitors.

76
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.820
Sarah Michaels: yep yeah.

77
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.070
Anisha Hassan: This so like high tech I see like.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.500
Anisha Hassan: show her doing like two screens and i'm like wow.

79
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.350
Jessica Zaleski: But do your screens like swipe over can your mouse care is that how you have it set up to.

80
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.920
Susan Snay: yeah I can actually just click on the tab and slide it over to the other.

81
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.280
Jessica Zaleski: yo i'm using two totally different devices i'm not yeah.

82
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.790
Susan Snay: Like empty is when you see them touch the screen and they like drag it to the.

83
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.110
Jessica Zaleski: Other oh yeah yeah.

84
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.360
Susan Snay: yeah it's kind of fun once you figure it out.

85
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.620
Jessica Zaleski: yeah no I just have my IMAC and my chromebook going.

86
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.300
Susan Snay: I need your phone and yeah.

87
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:43.710
Jessica Zaleski: Well, it just depends, but my IMAC freezes up a lot, so I just have to have something you know the kids have been telling me that once i'm in my ap classes that have.

88
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:53.100
Jessica Zaleski: MAC books, has said that they've had some glitches it's because of the new update the big sur update that Kate it's called a cost a lot of problems.

Susan Snay: wow.

90
00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:03.810
Jessica Zaleski: I thought, a lot of teachers, there you can't have their video in Google meat anymore, it looks to them like their cameras on, but the students can't see them at all.

91
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.670

144
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:31.620
Raquel Fernandes: it's so different, and you know how to explain, like the topics, like the all the things that we put on top of the pieces are different like we put everything, basically, and then the the dough is different.

145
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:45.150

Susan Snay: title, I want to say ESP.

203
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:15.690
Jessica Zaleski: I know alright, so we just wanted to take a few minutes and talk to you about the norms, we had done the jam board and agreed upon sort certain norms and expectations for the group so we just wanted to quickly review those Okay, before we start today so let's take a look here.

204
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:28.590
Susan Snay: Everyone thought that it was really important to be respectful of all Members will be respectful of all Members.

205
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.020
salam: Miss she said her wife is not working.

206
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.180
Oh no.

207
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.570
Jessica Zaleski: Well, just tell her to keep trying if she can.

208
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.210
salam: Okay okay.

209
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:47.970
All right.

210
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.940
Jessica Zaleski: Do we want to have people take turns reading or however you want to handle them.

211
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.850

212
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.270
Reggie: card and hopeful.

213
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.250

214
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.330
Susan Snay: keisha picture came up I apologize.

215
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.250
How about the next one.

216
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.810
Keyshawn: You want to read this one.

217
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.800
Edwin Bermejo: participate share your ideas and ask questions really important.

218
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:43.500
Jessica Zaleski: Now the the first three norms were all ones that came from you guys that you.

219
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:54.990
Jessica Zaleski: agreed on and thought of on the jam board and then one thing that missing and I shared That was really important to us is that we start and each session on time, so we promised you guys.

220
00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:06.510
Jessica Zaleski: That we would start and end now, sometimes when we're getting started there's some technical issues, but we appreciate you here being here by three o'clock on Fridays and 12 o'clock on.

221
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:13.080
Jessica Zaleski: Saturdays are letting us know what's going on and we promised that we will end each session on time.

222
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:36.630
Jessica Zaleski: So you guys came up with the first three and we agreed upon those we added in the fourth one too, because we consider that part of being respectful of the Members and then there was one norm, that we agreed on before this even started.

223
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.640
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

224
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.280
Leandro Graterol: Can I say that you know we don't.

225
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:47.190
Leandro Graterol: Keep your cameras on especially well in breakout rooms right.

226
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:56.640
Susan Snay: Now that's really important, especially when we might have some issues with the microphones or sound because.

227
00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:14.220
Susan Snay: it's easier to understand when somebody is trying to speak or wants to speak if they put their thumb up or if they put their hand up, but if we can't see anybody in the in the picture we're not sure that they're trying to participate okay so it's really important to have that on.

228
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.110
salam: Do you need to write this down.

229
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.270
Susan Snay: Not necessarily we're just going over we wanted to make sure that everybody remembers what we all agreed on.

230
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:31.980
Okay.

231
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:51.720
Jessica Zaleski: And so yeah so those were part you guys know that, like, for you this is part of your job right, and if you had a job, where the expectation was that you needed to wear a certain uniform or something like that you.

232
00:21:52.290 --> 00:22:05.520
Jessica Zaleski: You know you have to be responsible and show up to work and your uniform or if you, you know, need to be there, you know you need to bring your ID to your job, whatever it is.

233
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:16.950
Jessica Zaleski: One of the requirements for this is that you keep your cameras on so we're asking you know, because you agreed to this to do everything you can to have your cameras on.

234
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:30.360
Jessica Zaleski: Throughout the whole session and it in when we go into breakout rooms, this is especially important because it's a smaller group and it's much harder we're going into breakout rooms usually to have conversations, so we need the cameras to be on it's.

235
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.430
Susan Snay: easier for you all, when you're actually able to see each other and talk to each other.

236
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.000
Jessica Zaleski: Miss B or Sarah anything else you want to add on these.

237
00:22:44.940 --> 00:23:01.260
Ms. B: um I guess another thing is, if you are able to talk rather than type in the chat we do want to hear your voices that's very important we want to hear what you're thinking and also want you to have the ability to let everybody else here what's on your mind.

238
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.220
Susan Snay: that's a good point because sometimes it's hard to see the chat if the person is presenting.

239
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:18.210
Susan Snay: All they see is the presentation screen and they can't see the chat that's going on, so they they miss out on that, but we want to make sure that everybody gets to hear what your thoughts are good point.

240
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.300
Okay.

241
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.560
Jessica Zaleski: Sarah did you want to share anything.

242
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.270
Sarah Michaels: um no just that sometimes.

243
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:51.420
Sarah Michaels: You know, sometimes your camera is on but you can't see you, and so we really want to actually be able to see your face, so we can see your expression, and you can see each other's it's kind of it's it's it's kind of for everyone it's it's not for us it's so you guys can.

244
00:23:53.130 --> 00:24:13.050
Sarah Michaels: kind of be more in in the conversation in the group so we really, really want you guys, to make a huge effort around that it's one of the reasons that we get permission to do this and we get some support and it's why we can give you guys a stipend so it's really important.

245
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:27.990
Sarah Michaels: It gives you more of a sense of community to if you can actually see these people that are a part of this, you know this team with you so make sure to put forth the effort so that we can all appreciate every every person in this group.

246
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:41.790
Jessica Zaleski: Right so yesterday we left off with um we had been working in our groups to kind of come up with ideas of how.

247
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:53.700
Jessica Zaleski: Do the traits get from our parents from parent to offspring, and we were working in those those jam boards and had some ideas about that.

248
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.660
Jessica Zaleski: See oh there we go.

249
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:18.450
Jessica Zaleski: There we go um so I just want to go back to that GM board right now and we're going to take a look at what everyone had to say and we're going to start to develop some rules, these are going to be part of our initial model, our initial explanation of how.

250
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.710
Jessica Zaleski: Parents pass traits.

251
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.260
Jessica Zaleski: To their offspring Okay, so let me open up the jam board here.

252
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:41.460
Jessica Zaleski: And while, while we are sharing these ideas I know someone's going to be putting them into slide 13 and the presentation, for us, so let's just take a minute here.

253
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:54.120
Jessica Zaleski: And I don't know how would you want to like ask a volunteer to read the ideas, what do we want to how do we, how do you want to go about processing this information.

254
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:55.380
salam: yeah.

255
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.180
Ms. B: volunteer from each group might be.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:09.030
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, great So can I add add when angie and Salaam in this group I can't remember who else was in our group.

258
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.700
Jessica Zaleski: Here from group one.

259
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.410
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

260
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.810
Edwin Bermejo: um the egg party split and each one has different DNA.

261
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.100
Okay.

262
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.000

salam: I turned it off and still I cannot see the presentation I just only see you.

265
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.230
Edwin Bermejo: yeah that happens to me too I usually leave the room leave the meeting and come back and it works.

266
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.220
salam: Okay, this can I leave it a comeback.

salam: Thank you.

269
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.130
Who else wants to read, one of the sticky notes from group one.

270
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:06.750
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): I can.

271
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.120
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): um I said because we share the same genes.

272
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.630
Jessica Zaleski: So the trade Scott, so you introduced this word genes here and Jay that's great.

273
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:37.020
Jessica Zaleski: Because we talked about traits like physical traits like size of nose, or maybe you know hair color eye color and then you're talking about jeans so that's interesting we're going to start to add that into our thinking.

274
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:45.030
Sarah Michaels: And I see somebody else wrote genetic which is similar to two genes.

275
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:55.920
Jessica Zaleski: mm hmm yeah those are kind of together here so maybe if I organize these I see you know Edwin mentioned something about an egg and then there's another CRM.

276
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:14.010
Jessica Zaleski: And says, I think there's an egg from mom and there is like an egg from a father so something like that, and then were like How does it get there, some people said I think it's from the umbilical cord and gets from the cell and blood I think it's from the DNA.

277
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.220
Jessica Zaleski: Okay cool.

278
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:26.580
salam: Again, when I tried to turn on my camera so I guess a mug on my phone and turn on the camera there and be talking on this one.

279
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:35.460
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, great so i'm good troubleshooting Salaam all right let's take a look at what group to had and see if we see any similarities okay.

280
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.720
Jessica Zaleski: I don't know who was in group to.

281
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.040
Nhi Huynh: I was.

282
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.760
OK.

283
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:49.140
Nhi Huynh: So I said the genes are carry from Paris to the offspring on chromosome.

284
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:49.830
Okay.

285
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:58.470
Nhi Huynh: ready is the past is passing on trees from the parents to the offspring there's another word that.

286
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.850
Jessica Zaleski: yeah they brought in heredity and chromosomes.

287
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.320
salam: yep to.

288
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.180
Jessica Zaleski: yeah okay great.

289
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.540
Ms. B: And we had Christopher and reggie.

290
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:19.110
Reggie: I, so I said, I think that parts of the DNA were transferred to their offspring.

291
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.860
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right so we've got DNA there TRAN being transferred somehow okay.

292
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:33.360
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: I said, I think that genes aren't physical traits that you have here.

293
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:46.590
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, was it coltrane's genes are in the physical traits that you inherit Okay, can you just add a What do you mean by physical traits is that what is that what are you thinking of when you say physical traits.

294
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.530
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Like your what your eye color your.

295
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.480
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: skin color.

296
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.130
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: yeah.

297
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.880
Sarah Michaels: yeah it's have a similar question Chris when you say, I think that genes are in.

298
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:15.300
Sarah Michaels: The physical traits do you mean that there are genes in your eyes your eye color.

299
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.880
Sarah Michaels: Yes, he says okay.

300
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:39.990
Ms. B: yeah when we were in the group Christopher Nikki and reggie were talking about the genes being in the DNA and the DNA being in the Center of the cell and they got a little bit more in depth of how these things could be transferring over after much careful thought and reflected.

301
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:43.470
Jessica Zaleski: At.

302
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.440
Sarah Michaels: Somebody else said, parents and grandparents so now we're bringing in.

303
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:57.000
Sarah Michaels: This reminds me of the that we know something about the girls, the twins grandparents.

304
00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:10.560
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so I think we got some similarity here in the thinking that the the DNA in the genes are being passed from grandparent to parent to offspring.

305
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:19.740
Jessica Zaleski: Through her reddit heredity Okay, so that was what Nikki said their genes what genes are.

306
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.580
Jessica Zaleski: This is about DNA being transferred again.

307
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:32.610
Jessica Zaleski: And no Okay, this is interesting, so not all offspring get the same genes that's interesting.

308
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:43.830
I wonder if that came from the conversation we asked students if they had similarities with their siblings and many of the students said no, we you know we look very different.

309
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:55.080
Ms. B: Okay yeah they started to discuss on when the gene start moving around when mom and dad's jeans move together, there were trying to figure out how you get one from the other.

310
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.100
Okay.

311
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.760
Jessica Zaleski: All right, let's take a look at group of.

312
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:08.790
Jessica Zaleski: Three here, so how to trade school from parents offspring all right group three I wants to read one of their sticky notes from our group or three.

313
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.230
group three.

314
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:24.810
salam: yep I can hear you.

315
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:27.570
Sarah Michaels: My tiny didn't know.

316
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.670
Jessica Zaleski: i'm sure can.

317
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.940
Ms. B: yeah that's good.

318
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.440
Jessica Zaleski: I think we've got to do that these are probably big enough to raid.

319
00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.230
Susan Snay: We could probably shrink back down after we read them to.

320
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.280
salam: Stephen i'm not from that group can I read one.

321
00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.670
salam: I don't know if it's okay.

322
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.870
Sarah Michaels: Go ahead go ahead.

323
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.870
salam: um I read the one genes DNA and blood cells.

324
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:18.030
salam: And I think it is right, I don't know I think they get it, they get it like from DNA and blood.

325
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.110
Jessica Zaleski: So I see some similarities as Salaam that reminds me of some of the things that.

326
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:35.280
Jessica Zaleski: You you and the others in group one said right there was something about the blood and the DNA right yeah.

327
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.210
salam: And and Miss about like I was talking about genetics to.

328
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.370
Jessica Zaleski: yeah okay.

329
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:47.700
Susan Snay: So I think he Sean had his hand up maybe K Sean do you want to read the one that you a little post it note that you put up.

330
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:49.290
Leandro Graterol: When I read that.

331
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.680
Keyshawn: cell and and.

332
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:15.690
Keyshawn: nucleus mega mega up the DNA for the traits stingy genes keyshia.

333
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.670
Susan Snay: very young.

334
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:34.410
Susan Snay: So new excel and the nucleus, make up the DNA for the traits so we're now associated it looks like you've made a connection between the cell a nucleus inside the cell and that DNA is involved in their awesome.

335
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:36.630
Great.

336
00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.420
Who said something about their curly hair wants to read that one.

337
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:58.500
Alma Araujo: was one that I put up, so the top right square was the one that I put up.

338
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:11.640
Susan Snay: The shape of my eyes in my family is very common so it must be something that is passed on to most offspring, so when I look at a family picture, a lot of people in my family have the same shape eyes.

339
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.370
Sarah Michaels: Never noticed the shape of your eyes, can you bend into the screen.

340
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.960
Sarah Michaels: yeah interesting.

341
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.600
Jessica Zaleski: android did you want to read what you wrote.

342
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:30.120
Leandro Graterol: Wait.

343
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:43.560
Leandro Graterol: So um I had the same nose, as my father and I had it because of the genius of my family on the corner of my father and mother okay.

344
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.250
Susan Snay: So does anybody else in your family have your father's knows.

345
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.880
Leandro Graterol: leandra ha.

346
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.260
Susan Snay: Is there any other family members that have the same nose.

347
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.250
Leandro Graterol: As I think my life I think my.

348
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.000
Leandro Graterol: grandpa.

349
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.890
Jessica Zaleski: yeah oh boy oh.

350
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.000
Leandro Graterol: yeah well.

351
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:10.680
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

352
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.350
Jessica Zaleski: Right.

353
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.220
Susan Snay: You think I wonder if it has to do with whether they're male or female, I don't.

354
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.990
Jessica Zaleski: Well that's interesting just making me think i'm just thinking out loud.

355
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.410
Susan Snay: All right, last one.

356
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.960
was to me that, last week, he.

357
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.590
Alma Araujo: was my sticky note I don't know you want me to read it.

358
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:41.910
Sarah Michaels: yeah read it.

359
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:55.680
Alma Araujo: So my mom and my maternal grandmother and then my grandma's that they all had curly hair and now I have curly hair and then almost no one else in the family has just has been us.

360
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:05.760
Susan Snay: Oh that's interesting because that kind of addresses what I just said, I said I was thinking, maybe it has something to do with male and female, but you said that your.

361
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.930
Susan Snay: mom your grandmother, and your grandmother's dad.

362
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.830
Alma Araujo: yeah have curly hair so maybe it doesn't okay.

363
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.400
Jessica Zaleski: All right, let's take a look at the last group here right Green Group.

364
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:35.100
Jessica Zaleski: So I can see that Nora was in this group kaplan was in this group and.

365
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.300
Jessica Zaleski: i'm not sure who else.

366
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.570
Sarah Michaels: yeah who else I forget.

367
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.060
Sarah Michaels: I put my number right oh good so you're has to.

368
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.180
Jessica Zaleski: Go awesome Nora can you share those with us what What did you write.

369
00:37:52.050 --> 00:38:01.440
noora: So I arrow I feel as if some people get an equal amount of traits from both parents, I also feel like as the baby's slowly getting its facial structure that's when the features get noticeable.

370
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.900
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

371
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:12.180
noora: And you get some from your mother and others from your father, like a big nose I color and etc okay all right.

372
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:29.490
Jessica Zaleski: that's interesting, so you think this is interesting because you've now brought up this idea that people get an equal amount from both parents Okay, but you're saying, some people, so do you think everybody does get an equal amount of trades from both parents are only some people.

373
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.300
noora: I feel like some because some people look more like their father than them.

374
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.590
Jessica Zaleski: Okay okay.

375
00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.990
Jessica Zaleski: That is okay good all right.

376
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.860
Jessica Zaleski: Catherine, do you want to share what you wrote.

377
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:13.020
Right so catlin posted on a sticky note it happens in the mother's womb, so what would what happens, what do you mean something happens.

378
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.780
Jessica Zaleski: and capital, and you can say explain it in Portuguese that's fine and a cow will translate for you.

379
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.680
Jessica Zaleski: that'd be interesting to hear it and forth yeah.

380
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:31.860
Do you watch people desk now just so good to see.

381
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:42.270
Raquel Fernandes: She said she thinks traits develop happened when the baby is in the mother's womb, so, while it's developing okay.

382
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:54.120
Jessica Zaleski: Great Thank you Catherine that was great you were the first one, I think, to mention like where this, you know that the mothers when we've talked about the umbilical cord a little bit, but.

383
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.100
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

384
00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.240
Susan Snay: So that's it and she also mentioned that it's developing.

385
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:05.310
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, in the womb, so I wonder so developing.

386
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:23.970
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we have we're going to now switch over i'm going to switch slides here to go to slide number 13 where a nice shot has been adding in everything that we have been talking about.

387
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:31.530
Jessica Zaleski: When he has been hard at work typing all these in, so I think we need to take a look and.

388
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:46.110
Jessica Zaleski: This is the same question is worded a little bit different because we said how to trade get from parents to offspring, but I think it was Nikki that added in that word heredity right so heredity is.

389
00:40:47.490 --> 00:41:03.600
Jessica Zaleski: The information is information that can be passed down so, how does the her reputable information get from the parents to the offspring like how did.

390
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:28.470
Jessica Zaleski: The information that gave Leandro the same knows as his father, how did that get into Leandro right if you how did for all my how did that information so that she would have curly hair, like her mother and her grandmother and her grand mother's father, how did that get into Alma.

391
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.750
salam: From the RNA.

392
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.310
salam: Because it makes a copy of some of like that information.

393
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:43.530
Jessica Zaleski: So these are some of the ideas that you guys just shared so.

394
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:56.070
Jessica Zaleski: let's take a look at these again i'm just going to kind of read through them and we'll see if we want to i'm going to you know what i'm going to do is i'm not going to do it and present mode, so that we can add it a little bit if we want to be shortened or stay exactly.

395
00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:08.160
Jessica Zaleski: To go yep so and and let's try to remember like we're asking like How does this happen Okay, so we want to be giving information that helps to support.

396
00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:18.570
Jessica Zaleski: And answer that question okay so let's take a look at the first one egg split into two and each one has different DNA transferred from the DNA.

397
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:23.850
Jessica Zaleski: And then so we've got this idea weight of an egg.

398
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:34.380
Jessica Zaleski: um let's see do we agree or disagree, do we think that all eggs split into two when there's.

399
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:42.060
Jessica Zaleski: Information being passed down to all eggs split when offsprings being created, what do you guys think.

400
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.070
Leandro Graterol: You know.

401
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.300
Susan Snay: I know i'm not a twin.

402
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.170
Jessica Zaleski: yeah when does an egg split what happens when an egg splits.

403
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:58.320
salam: Because they're going to look different than the other.

404
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:21.570
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so um maybe we want to kind of keep this idea why don't we and nisha can you maybe make a copy of this slide and we'll keep that one for later because we might have more questions about it, but we know that, like we're kind of agreeing that eggs don't always split into two.

405
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.350
Susan Snay: But sometimes they can.

406
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:39.900
Jessica Zaleski: But sometimes they can okay now somebody said there's something like an egg from the father, so I know in my group we talked a little bit about this that there's an egg where did who does the egg who gives the egg.

407
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.560
salam: The mom.

408
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:58.260
Jessica Zaleski: The mom okay so maybe we need to add that in there, like there's an egg there is an egg from the mother right and there's something like an egg right from the father.

409
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.380
Susan Snay: Okay Sean type something in the chat.

410
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.070
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, can you.

411
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.510
Susan Snay: Use the sperm so.

412
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.100
Jessica Zaleski: Oh okay.

413
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.530
Susan Snay: Something the quote something like an egg.

414
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:13.050
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, there is okay so we're going to just change we can just change that and their sperm, and this.

415
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:29.400
Susan Snay: This process that we're going through is we're trying to set up a model or set of rules that can help us explain this question that we have here, and you all are coming up with them and they may change as we go through this this is part of the process.

416
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.720
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right looks good so far alright so.

417
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.510
Sarah Michaels: offspring gets i'd say one thing so yeah.

418
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:37.950
Sarah Michaels: So um.

419
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:53.280
Sarah Michaels: Was it key shonda Okay, so there is sperm and then somebody said it's something like an egg so there's something about that that is similar to the egg so there's sperm from the father.

420
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.680
Sarah Michaels: And it has something in common with with an egg yeah sorry my screen is crazy.

421
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.560
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so something yeah something like an egg he Sean saying it's called a sperm.

422
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:22.200
Jessica Zaleski: we're saying it's an egg from the mother offspring get some traits from some traits from father and some from mother some get equal some don't okay.

423
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:32.100
Jessica Zaleski: On that was cells kind of talking about how does it get passed passes through the blood umbilical cord develops in the mother's womb okay.

424
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.870
Jessica Zaleski: We share the same genes genetic.

425
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.090
Jessica Zaleski: streams that are inside.

426
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.150
Sarah Michaels: There, my question is, we share the same.

427
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:49.650
Sarah Michaels: jam, with whom.

428
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.090
Jessica Zaleski: yeah yeah.

429
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:58.050
Susan Snay: I know they all the same, are we sharing, all the same genes.

430
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:06.990
Susan Snay: Like are my jeans all the same as my mother's.

431
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.830
No.

432
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:16.860
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so should we change this statement, a little bit do we can we say we share the same genes what should How should we change that statement, a little bit.

433
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:20.970
salam: Like us, because.

434
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:29.160
salam: Not all of people like share the same genes, some people like share some of them and say.

435
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:32.070
salam: Okay, like share nothing at all.

436
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.900
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so we share some.

437
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:34.860
Jessica Zaleski: Of the same genes.

438
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:42.210
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, and you think so on that some people share, none of the same genes yeah with their parents.

439
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.840
salam: Sometimes, like I seen people like that.

440
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.940
Sarah Michaels: Okay, where they don't look anything at all, like them.

441
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:52.800
Sarah Michaels: So you think.

442
00:46:53.880 --> 00:47:04.590
salam: It might be their eyes or something but, like the person that I seen before, like nothing like their parents, they look like different.

443
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:19.830
Sarah Michaels: So that question, do we agree or not, that you could actually share no jeans or no yeah jeans with with one of your parents, what do you guys think.

444
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:21.270
Nhi Huynh: I disagree.

445
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.280
Sarah Michaels: Why.

446
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:38.190
Nhi Huynh: Because, like the offspring at least have like some like miss between the model of Father Father genes if they don't have the genes from their parents and they must be adopted.

447
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:53.520
Susan Snay: Well, maybe so Nikki, I think, maybe when we have this discussion, we should probably really say, are we talking about biological offspring or non biological So are we related biologically or not yeah.

448
00:47:54.390 --> 00:48:02.940
Ms. B: Or maybe we should also try to figure out if we're talking about genes or just what we look like, are we saying that we're not sharing.

449
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:14.430
Ms. B: Any physical looks or are we not sharing the genes that are what make up those particular physical look so it's it do you want to explain further do you think there's a.

450
00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:26.850
Ms. B: easier way to make that determination are we talking about the same thing, are they two different things, so you could not look like a person does that mean you don't have their genes or what do you think that means.

451
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:32.910
Jessica Zaleski: yeah let's I love where you're going with this must be because I had the same thought because we've got this statement up here that.

452
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:53.790
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, my goodness sorry offspring get some trait traits from their father and some from their mothers and then down here we're saying we share some of the same genes with our parents i'm just going to make these different colors so we can kind of examine them more closely all right.

453
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.860
Anisha Hassan: kesha and also said something interesting in the chat that some jeans are more dominant.

454
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.800
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, what does that mean.

455
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.750
What do you mean by they're more dominant what would that mean.

456
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.590
Keyshawn: they're stronger.

457
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:23.610
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, stronger okay so some i'm going to add that in some jeans are more dominant stronger.

458
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:40.260
salam: commit sometimes they might not look like their dad or mom they might look like their grandma or grandma or someone else oh there's a good point too, so just because you don't look like your parents doesn't mean that some of those traits are not found in your family.

459
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.310
Susan Snay: somewhere else.

460
00:49:43.290 --> 00:50:00.930
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so when we say traits are we talking well and i'm asking you guys like What do you mean by that are you talking about the actual information that's being passed down or are we talking about like what you see your physical traits.

461
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.800
Jessica Zaleski: Like Nora I think you're the one that.

462
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.090
Jessica Zaleski: Is it you that originally made that statement, nor that some get.

463
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:26.880
Jessica Zaleski: traits yes Okay, so when you said that what were you thinking were you thinking, like the actual like the stuff in the DNA we're not sure exactly how this all is all working at this point, but are you talking about that, like genetic information are you talking about like what you see.

464
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.970
Jessica Zaleski: With traits.

465
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:44.700
Susan Snay: In other words, what what what are traits to to you as students are traits just something you can see, on the outside.

466
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:58.230
salam: I don't think so.

467
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:01.620
salam: too.

468
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.620
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so.

469
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:16.290
salam: Because like I feel on the inside, too, because, like I don't know what my mom gets called my sister like suddenly gets called to for some reason I don't know why.

470
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:27.570
Ms. B: So from yesterday's session in the chat someone mentioned that traits are characteristics, so are characteristics, something that you see.

471
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.650
Ms. B: Or can observe right and observe them.

472
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.380
Ms. B: What do you think.

473
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:43.110
Ms. B: Are they the same thing, or are they different.

474
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.610
Leandro Graterol: Do.

475
00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.120
Ms. B: You think traits and characteristics are different.

476
00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:51.390
Leandro Graterol: Yes.

477
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:59.100
Ms. B: Okay, so some of them are different but can you see them with your eyes, with the naked eye.

478
00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:02.820
salam: Like on a person miss.

479
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.510
Ms. B: yeah.

480
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:05.220
Ms. B: A person yeah, why not yeah.

481
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:05.880
yeah.

482
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.010
Ms. B: So thumbs up.

483
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:16.590
Ms. B: If you think you can see them with your eyes or thumbs down if you think you cannot see them see if we can see, I see one.

484
00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:18.510
Sarah Michaels: Oh.

485
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:25.140
Sarah Michaels: Okay, no Okay, yes Shannon says yes.

486
00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:31.440
Ms. B: I see a few thumbs up and one some down, but there are a lot of people with no screens on so.

487
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:36.390
Ms. B: I was wondering if you could possibly turn your camera on so he could see what your vote is.

488
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:37.140
yeah.

489
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.220
Sarah Michaels: thumbs up or thumbs down.

490
00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.470
Ms. B: or use your reactions.

491
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.560
Sarah Michaels: caitlin raise your hand up a little higher.

492
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:47.970
Very.

493
00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:55.500
Ms. B: Little higher Okay, I saw key sean's nor will you thumbs up or thumbs down.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:04.500
noora: I did it put my thumb up or down.

495
00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:08.460
Ms. B: In between yeah between.

496
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.070
Ms. B: Years okay.

497
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:12.330
Susan Snay: i'm not sure.

498
00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.580
Ms. B: not sure and that's fine.

499
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:18.090
Ms. B: looks like.

500
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.840
Leandro Graterol: or two, but I think it's yeah I think this deeper.

501
00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:23.820
Susan Snay: Number one week when we.

502
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.350
Susan Snay: First, put together these these ideas, the beginning stages of a.

503
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:28.860
model.

504
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.270
Susan Snay: They are always something that we can change we can change our.

505
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.510
mind.

506
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:35.700
Ms. B: formation.

507
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:40.200
Susan Snay: So don't worry about being right or wrong at this point i'm just give your opinions.

508
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.720
Ms. B: yep so just seeing what you think.

509
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:53.970
Jessica Zaleski: The one thing that you know me helped to inform like my vote on this, if I was going to vote was if I go back to slide nine when we were looking at these pictures.

510
00:53:54.360 --> 00:54:07.140
Jessica Zaleski: It said how Lucy and Maria look depends on the traits they got from their parents and then the question was do you have physical traits that resemble those of your family members.

511
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:18.960
Jessica Zaleski: So what do you think when we're talking about physical when we're talking about traits is it physical things that we can see or observe, or is it.

512
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.180
Jessica Zaleski: Like Watson ourselves are those the same thing.

513
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:36.030
Nhi Huynh: um I think trace can be both physical appearance and characteristics passing from your family tree.

514
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:44.130
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so when you say characteristics Nikki is like like maybe behaviors or um.

515
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:45.780
Nhi Huynh: Yes.

516
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.210
Jessica Zaleski: Certain things about okay alright so.

517
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:55.200
Jessica Zaleski: What if we said physical what, if we so some people agree that a things you can see, like physical.

518
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.460
Jessica Zaleski: traits right.

519
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.280
Susan Snay: yeah that's that's the obvious one because we're looking at those two.

520
00:54:59.310 --> 00:54:59.670
yeah.

521
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.740
Jessica Zaleski: And then.

522
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:12.210
Jessica Zaleski: Nikki saying why don't we we said and characteristics that kind of covers what some other people are talking about like what Salam said about her sister.

523
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.430
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

524
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:19.350
Ms. B: My husband and my son laugh, the same way, I wonder if that's passed down.

525
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.050
Ms. B: Okay same exact laugh.

526
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.860
Sarah Michaels: same well.

527
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.860
salam: I have a question.

528
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:26.490
yeah.

529
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:36.120
salam: What what is it called like when someone wants to make a plastic surgery like to look like a different person like a same.

530
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:42.780
salam: look like a library and they look like each other, after they like get the surgery.

531
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.310
Sarah Michaels: or plastic surgery.

532
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:49.320
salam: yeah like is does that, like is it traits or something.

533
00:55:49.440 --> 00:56:06.690
Susan Snay: Who do you think if that person that had plastic surgery to look like a like a star movie star, do you think they could pass those traits those new physical that new knows that they had built on their face could they pass that on to their offspring.

534
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:08.970
salam: No, no.

535
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:14.940
salam: plastic surgery like they did it to look like a different person.

536
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:26.250
Jessica Zaleski: Okay well hold on, I have a question then i'm going to look at this purple statement because it said, we said that maybe some people share no jeans with their parents.

537
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:45.150
Jessica Zaleski: Is that we share some of the state, we share it should say some of the same genes with our parents, maybe some people share no jeans but you're saying know if they get that knows changed that can't get passed on, because it's not the same genes.

538
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.250
hmm.

539
00:56:50.760 --> 00:57:02.940
salam: No like miss like they make a plastic surgery if, like not to look like one of the members of their family like someone else that may be a celebrity or someone their friend total no.

540
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:14.940
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, well then, but within why couldn't my if I did that, and then I had a baby why couldn't my baby and up with that new nose because maybe.

541
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:22.590
Nhi Huynh: Because you were born with like the genes of short knows, so when you like.

542
00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:30.690
Nhi Huynh: give birth like for new child, you cannot pass that genes length, it has a higher knows to your child.

543
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.280
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so.

544
00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:39.120
Jessica Zaleski: So Nikki you're saying, like, I have to pass the genes that I have on to my child.

545
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.090
Susan Snay: yeah if that's all you have.

546
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:49.680
Jessica Zaleski: yeah okay so let's get an agree or disagree on that one let's think about when Nikki just said she said.

547
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:59.880
Jessica Zaleski: You know that we have certain genes and those are the genes that we have to pass on to our children do you guys agree with that or disagree.

548
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.410
salam: I agree.

549
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.080
Reggie: Okay do.

550
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:05.310
Edwin Bermejo: I agree.

551
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:11.550
Leandro Graterol: john posted in the chat surgery did not change the genes.

552
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:13.170
Jessica Zaleski: Oh okay.

553
00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:18.480
salam: Should I guess is from like the blood into cells, this is why doesn't change.

554
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:31.890
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so should we maybe take this second part out maybe some people share no jeans because you're saying you don't agree with that, like the parents passed those jeans on so they have to share some jeans with their parents right.

555
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.260
salam: yeah I guess.

556
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:39.000
salam: You guys like I said, some people that doesn't that's why I said that.

557
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:46.800
salam: They could share something miss like I maybe didn't look like close on their face.

558
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.430
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, maybe you didn't look close it out okay right.

559
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:57.060
Sarah Michaels: And it goes back to something key Sean said, maybe you have the genes, but they're not as strong.

560
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.850
Jessica Zaleski: I might want to move that up here like Oh, my goodness.

561
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:24.180
Jessica Zaleski: let's let's keep going let's hold on to that idea for a second because we're going to talk a little bit more we kind of talk here about genes are inside the DNA, which are in the Center of the cell Okay, the cell and nucleus, make up the DNA for the traits in jeans.

562
00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:31.050
Jessica Zaleski: jeans genes are passed from parent to their offspring through chromosomes.

563
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:38.760
Jessica Zaleski: Okay heredity is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring.

564
00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:52.710
Jessica Zaleski: genes and physical traits that are passed from grandparents to parents to offspring are common in a family, so this is kind of combining those ideas yeah.

565
00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:03.270
Jessica Zaleski: So it says genes in physical traits so this one's saying that like genes and physical traits aren't the same thing, what that.

566
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.740
Jessica Zaleski: The traits come from the genes.

567
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.600
Sarah Michaels: And you could you say that keens.

568
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:22.830
Sarah Michaels: determine the traits or genes make the traits what they are there's some connection between reactions and.

569
01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.680
Jessica Zaleski: Everything in but jeans.

570
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:28.860
See.

571
01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:40.830
Jessica Zaleski: If we just say create physical traits but that's what they're talking that's what you guys have a timeout because key Sean down here was saying that some genes are stronger than others.

572
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:54.330
Jessica Zaleski: And that not all offsprings offspring get the same genes, so what would happen if you and your sibling got the exact same genes.

573
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.680
Jessica Zaleski: What do you think exact same.

574
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.060
Leandro Graterol: thing can you repeat the question.

575
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:10.710
Jessica Zaleski: yeah what would happen in your family if if you and your well i'm going to use you for an example Andrew if you and your brother got the exact same genes, what would happen.

576
01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:17.070
Reggie: When we just look like us for blue magic i'm saying yeah we could be twins.

577
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:17.910
yeah.

578
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:26.940
Jessica Zaleski: So if you guys got if you guys got the exact same genes, as one of your siblings you're saying you'd be twins.

579
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:34.230
Reggie: Okay Okay, so if we were invited same time we probably won't be twins, but we would just look at.

580
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.470
Like.

581
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:48.960
Sarah Michaels: I have a sister, who is exactly a year younger than me and even though I was taller than her when we were growing up people used to ask us if we were twins but we looked so much alike.

582
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:56.640
Jessica Zaleski: But Sarah do you think that and we can ask the Group do you think that you and your sister have the exact same genes.

583
01:01:56.910 --> 01:02:03.360
Sarah Michaels: We don't look exactly alike at all, really, but we look pretty similar.

584
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:13.710
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so maybe that goes back to what key Sean was saying that some of those genes that you got were more dominant and you're saying you didn't get all the same genes either.

585
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:19.500
Sarah Michaels: yeah we don't look exactly like but we as when we were younger people used to say you twins.

586
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:26.280
salam: Changes me miss I don't know how is it right.

587
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.110
Leandro Graterol: Below like twins but they're dropping something.

588
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.110
Jessica Zaleski: I want.

589
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.190
Sarah Michaels: You say that again.

590
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:48.390
salam: I thought, like then like if they look exactly the same, but they're not born like like the same time to see me year or whatever, but like I thought that infamy rob or something.

591
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.760
Jessica Zaleski: Of the genes meetup.

592
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:53.430
Jessica Zaleski: yeah oh okay.

593
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.180
hmm.

594
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.980
salam: I don't know missy understand what I just.

595
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:14.670
Jessica Zaleski: know I we can we can talk about that a little bit more, I just want to go back to what I think it was reggie I can't see the screen right now, because i'm looking at this, but I think it was reggie and a few others Leandro maybe maybe Edwin said, like.

596
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.160
Jessica Zaleski: What what What did you guys say about twins what do we know.

597
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.580
Jessica Zaleski: You said, if this happens, they be twins if what happens.

598
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:28.500
yeah.

599
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:33.240
Leandro Graterol: I think they can look like twins but they're not you know.

600
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.460
Jessica Zaleski: So siblings can look.

601
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.470
Jessica Zaleski: Similar but not be twins right.

602
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:37.800
yeah.

603
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.360
Reggie: Because he because he.

604
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.190
Jessica Zaleski: hi savannah.

605
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.740
Reggie: Because even like most wins that game we're on the same day, but they don't look anything like so.

606
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:55.740
Susan Snay: So now Okay, so now we're getting anything twins can be born on the same day, but not look alike.

607
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.530
salam: yeah it might be like from the blonde.

608
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:06.750
salam: I don't know look to them to look like I guess is from the DNA might be.

609
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:26.130
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so you're saying that twins can be born on the same day, but not be identical, which means exactly the same, but you guys said, if they had the exact same genes, what would happen.

610
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.730
Susan Snay: Exactly the same.

611
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:38.490
Jessica Zaleski: If siblings have the exact same genes.

612
01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:40.740
salam: That will be twins.

613
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:43.890
Edwin Bermejo: look like.

614
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.860
Jessica Zaleski: yeah what do we call it when they look exactly alike.

615
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:47.730
Edwin Bermejo: I just tickle.

616
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.950
Jessica Zaleski: yeah okay.

617
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:51.690
Sarah Michaels: So that's what.

618
01:04:51.750 --> 01:05:03.660
Jessica Zaleski: You guys were saying that I said what happens if you get the exact same genes, you and your brother get add when get the exact same genes, you said we'd look exactly we look identical.

619
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.510
amazing.

620
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:16.800
Ms. B: And when we were looking at the twins before someone else mentioned a term of what twins would be if they weren't, the same does anyone remember what that term was.

621
01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:24.060
Ms. B: If they're twins but they're not identical what was that term someone mentioned it, the other day at.

622
01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.260
Sarah Michaels: T Sean knows.

623
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.700
Keyshawn: Are eternal.

624
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:39.690
Jessica Zaleski: Return all okay great i'm going to add that in fraternal twins so born in the same day, but not be identical those are fraternal twins.

625
01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:45.510
Susan Snay: What are Lucy and Maria are they fraternal or identical twins.

626
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:47.940
salam: Oh.

627
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.730
salam: God they're identical.

628
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.080
Jessica Zaleski: Well, do they look.

629
01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:59.100
Jessica Zaleski: Do you think that Lucy and Maria have the exact same genes from both parents.

630
01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:09.540
Jessica Zaleski: So see how we're already using our model here you're saying no if they don't have the exact same genes they can't be identical.

631
01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.940
Jessica Zaleski: They would be fraternal.

632
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:23.940
Jessica Zaleski: All right, you guys made a lot of progress on the model, this is great, this is like one of the hardest parts is like just getting to consensus and agreement on a model.

633
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:33.060
Jessica Zaleski: And we're going to go back and change this, as we learn more, but I think this is a great time to take a little break and when we come back we're going to actually start to talk about.

634
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:53.850
Jessica Zaleski: Some of these vocabulary words that you introduced in how this actually happens, and as you learn, we might have to go back and change some of the information and our model statements okay so it's 1257 so let's come back at 103 okay 1:03pm.

635
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.430
Susan Snay: Go stretch get something to drink.

636
01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:58.740
Susan Snay: Go to the bathroom and then come right back at 123.

637
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.530
Susan Snay: looks like the chats been pretty.

638
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:07.950
busy.

639
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:13.290
Jessica Zaleski: I bet I.

640
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.220
Ms. B: can see.

641
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:30.180
Ms. B: One thought that was in there, I didn't want to interrupt the flow of the chat that someone mentioned that there are people that look exactly alike, but they're not related or they don't share genes.

642
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.690
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so that is an interesting thing that will need to talk about.

643
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:43.770
Ms. B: Two people who are sisters, it was angie and I think, and he said yeah it was angie i'm trying to trying to find.

644
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:47.700
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah What about people who look alike, but don't have a relation.

645
01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.110
Jessica Zaleski: yeah to each other.

646
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.030
Jessica Zaleski: Like your doppelganger yeah.

647
01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.100
Sarah Michaels: yeah interested.

648
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:55.290
Ms. B: me and everybody has one right.

649
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.000
Jessica Zaleski: there's one person I would yeah.

650
01:07:57.090 --> 01:07:58.980
Ms. B: I would never want to run into them but.

651
01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:12.030
Sarah Michaels: Chris says me and my cousins that are twins yeah all look the same yeah so so the twins look the same that makes sense, but he also looks like them is that right, Chris.

652
01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:15.240
Sarah Michaels: yeah that looks interesting.

653
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.870
Ms. B: I wonder about the phenomenon of twins being raised somewhere else if their characteristics are the same.

654
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.330
Sarah Michaels: yeah well it's happening friends.

655
01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:28.710
Raquel Fernandes: And yeah but it's really interesting because my brothers are twins identical.

656
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.390
Raquel Fernandes: And even though they are identical to have such different personalities.

657
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.950
Susan Snay: Oh, so now we're getting into something else, not just something we can see, but.

658
01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:42.270
Sarah Michaels: Right, you know.

659
01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.770
Susan Snay: Why, that is what their.

660
01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:50.550
Sarah Michaels: behavior and I know somebody who's an identical twin who.

661
01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:57.390
Sarah Michaels: Is his his brother is the dominant cause of the dominant twin he was.

662
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:59.460
Sarah Michaels: Born first and.

663
01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:05.280
Sarah Michaels: he's I don't know, do you have a sense with your brothers that one is the dominant twin know.

664
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:21.930
Raquel Fernandes: They alternate like it depends on the year basically money so a first like one was usually more dominant and the other and they switch and now they're like grab their 16 now they've kind of switched again so it's really interesting to see them.

665
01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.130
Ms. B: I love watching the ones where they're like I was born 45 seconds before you so that makes me the oldest simply.

666
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:33.210
salam: Miss.

667
01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:35.520
salam: I have a question.

668
01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:46.380
salam: So does it mean if they're twins but they don't look alike and they're called identical twins is it like their DNA identical DNA.

669
01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:56.400
Susan Snay: So you're asking if two if two siblings do not look alike, but they're called identical.

670
01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.660
Susan Snay: yeah is their DNA, the same or different.

671
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.020
Susan Snay: yeah, what do you think.

672
01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:04.710
Ms. B: If they don't.

673
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:10.590
Susan Snay: Look alike, if they do not look alike, do you think that their DNA is the same or different.

674
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:20.880
salam: But I mean it's like if they do not look like, but they're twins like both of these girls I think it's called like identical DNA.

675
01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:25.920
Susan Snay: So what is the word identical mean if something is identical.

676
01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.170
salam: Like.

677
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.660
The same or different.

678
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:35.340
destroying.

679
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:37.110
Nhi Huynh: The same.

680
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:54.660
Susan Snay: One says the same So if I say it is identical I make an identical copy means i'm making the exact same copy so does Lucy and Maria look exactly the same know so are they identical.

681
01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:59.700
Susan Snay: No okay so what's the other term that we've been using.

682
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:09.720
Sarah Michaels: not identical twin with the other term the keystone the keystone number I think Sean said it.

683
01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.770
Sarah Michaels: Is anybody who's still on remember.

684
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.640
Susan Snay: And it's actually in the model, the notes, when we go back and look at it salon so we said, fraternal.

685
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:36.690
Susan Snay: And identical Those are the two types of twins so fraternal they don't look the same identical they do look the same.

686
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:40.350
So what would you say Maria and Lucy are.

687
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.350
fraternal or identical.

688
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:54.900
Susan Snay: might help to actually when we get to the model will take a look at those two words, you can actually see them written down.

689
01:11:56.130 --> 01:12:08.280
Sarah Michaels: yeah I think for eternal it comes from the Latin word for a tear which means brother, so you know they're brothers, but they're not identity, you know anyway for eternal no.

690
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.650
salam: Okay, I don't know if I ever get it, and everything wrong today.

691
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:33.930
Sarah Michaels: Oh no it's not it's not wrong, these are new words and it's just it's just getting you'll probably notice the word identical a lot like next next week you'll hear the word identical and then he'll know you'll laugh yeah.

692
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:42.930
Susan Snay: don't ever think that being wrong is an important part of learning that's how we remember things really by going through that struggle of being wrong.

693
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:47.460
yeah.

694
01:12:53.100 --> 01:13:01.440
Anisha Hassan: my sister, who is actually eight years older than me looks really, really similar to me, to the point that some people are like are you guys twins.

695
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:05.040
Anisha Hassan: me because she's eight years older than me.

696
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:10.860
Anisha Hassan: Also yeah we're similar right now but.

697
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.690
Anisha Hassan: i'm like you're 30 now Why do people.

698
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.330
Anisha Hassan: That I look like you.

699
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.040
Susan Snay: You feel good that when you get to be 30 you're going to look as young as you are now.

700
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:23.820
Jessica Zaleski: There you go.

701
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:30.630
Jessica Zaleski: I have two sisters and one is two years younger than I am, and the other is six years younger.

702
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:48.570
Jessica Zaleski: But we all have extremely similar voices, so we call each other voice twins and when our family members are on the phone they don't know who they're talking to, and I mean we do look very similar as well, but our voices are almost identical it's scary when we're all together.

703
01:13:49.230 --> 01:14:04.050
Sarah Michaels: I have the same thing my sister who's a year younger when we hear each other when we hear ourselves on a tape recorder, I say oh that's it's not me that's Kate my sister and Kate says the same thing, she doesn't sound.

704
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:05.130
Sarah Michaels: Like there's no she sounds like.

705
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.300
Sarah Michaels: And and people can't tell our voices apart yeah yeah.

706
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.000
Susan Snay: So there's a whole other.

707
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.810
Jessica Zaleski: I know.

708
01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.950
Susan Snay: yeah Nice, now we inheriting our voice too.

709
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.360
Sarah Michaels: yeah yeah.

710
01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.030
Sarah Michaels: Well, maybe the shape of our hope.

711
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:27.000
Jessica Zaleski: yeah how's that connected to us physically, you know that's a whole nother thing all right great.

712
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:32.580
Anisha Hassan: And all of my all my family members wear glasses so.

713
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.370
Anisha Hassan: Bad eyesight yes.

714
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.320
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe a bad dream.

715
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:45.720
Susan Snay: A lot you got on your phone good awesome.

716
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:52.800
Sarah Michaels: So one of my parents had really poor eyesight and the other head perfect eyesight and.

717
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:57.810
Sarah Michaels: my brother and sister have great eyesight and I got poor eyesight.

718
01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:05.550
Jessica Zaleski: All right, so.

719
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:16.560
Susan Snay: So if you can just if you can just turn on your camera so that we can see that you're here that everybody's back I add when.

720
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:17.700
Sarah Michaels: A.

721
01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:22.350
Susan Snay: young girl Christopher good right.

722
01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:27.000
Jessica Zaleski: Right so i'm going to go ahead and.

723
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.360
Jessica Zaleski: move on to the next slide here.

724
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:43.350
Jessica Zaleski: All right, and Miss saying I am just like boli passing the baton to you to lead this you and all right all right.

725
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:44.310
Susan Snay: hey yo.

726
01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:58.920
Susan Snay: that's just this is B, and this is ass right alright so as we go forward we're going to think of DNA as chromosomes you mentioned chromosomes in your little sticky notes and in the model.

727
01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:09.420
Susan Snay: You also have every group kind of mentioned DNA so we're going to combine those together we don't really use those words when we talk about this and chromosomes are tightly coiled.

728
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:22.680
Susan Snay: And found within ourselves so I used to use an old phone cord to demonstrate this where we were going to use that little bit of the video for this tool we waited we.

729
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.720
Jessica Zaleski: are no we're going to use that right now.

730
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:25.620
Susan Snay: All right, perfect.

731
01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.400
Okay.

732
01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:32.760
Susan Snay: So this is just to get you in the mindset of what we're talking about.

733
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.170
it's really low.

734
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.130
Jessica Zaleski: Can you hear it not really.

735
01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:46.290
Reggie: anything.

736
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:54.120
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so it's i'm not sure with I didn't know I could yeah okay yep that.

737
01:16:54.660 --> 01:17:05.190
Sarah Michaels: When you share your screen with zoom and you're going to show a video on that page where you start to share your screen, it says at the bottom optimize for video.

738
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:10.050
Jessica Zaleski: OK so maybe what i'll do is i'll just stop sharing.

739
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.140
Jessica Zaleski: For again and then share the new tab.

740
01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.030
Susan Snay: will try, if it doesn't work i'll talk through it.

741
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.720
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

742
01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.730
Anisha Hassan: eat it, you can try just.

743
01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:22.710
Anisha Hassan: Have we go as you turn your volume on your laptop is low.

744
01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:34.680
Ms. B: Do you see the icon yes, I do okay yeah cuz there's a backdoor way if you don't see it there, they also have it in the menu to to share your computer sound.

745
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:43.020
Ms. B: All these little tricks of the trade yep click on both.

746
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:50.040
Ms. B: optimize for video and share computer sound there so fancy fancy.

747
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:55.200
Jessica Zaleski: Oh.

748
01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:03.330
Leandro Graterol: I can hear it now, I can hear a little.

749
01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: yeah it's it's because OK OK OK, I.

750
01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:12.480
Ms. B: put this piece on this fine too yeah.

751
01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:21.180
Susan Snay: Okay, so we're actually looking at a cell and it's going to dive deep into the cell notice we're traveling past the organelles now we're going to get to the nucleus.

752
01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:31.260
Susan Snay: we're going to travel into inside the nucleus inside the nuclear pores now we're looking at a chromosome inside the nucleus, and this chromosome is going to unravel to show you.

753
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:48.270
Susan Snay: All of the different parts, these are the histones the proteins that DNA wraps around and then the DNA is going to stretch out even more so, you can see each of those bases that come together to form a gene which you guys mentioned.

754
01:18:49.470 --> 01:19:00.630
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so let's just take a look at that, because we really just wanted to show you when we when we're talking about on the chromosome This is like where it is and what it looks like to just see that again.

755
01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.660
Jessica Zaleski: Inside the nucleus.

756
01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:13.620
Ms. B: And that picture of the ladder we mentioned what that could be someone mentioned it earlier on what was that picture of the ladder, what do you think you could call it.

757
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.070
Jessica Zaleski: What is this right here.

758
01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:18.480
Reggie: Oh DNA.

759
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:27.750
Ms. B: Yes, its DNA and we also mentioned a model I think Nikki mentioned earlier that there's a DNA model that you may use in class.

760
01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:35.160
Ms. B: You mean the shape of it, the shape of it yeah the shape of it being a DNA model I think she had one on one of her classes.

761
01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.770
Sarah Michaels: name or double.

762
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.360
Jessica Zaleski: helix.

763
01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:40.680
Ms. B: Double helix very good.

764
01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:46.770
Susan Snay: Now, did you see when the two white lines actually separated part of the DNA.

765
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:50.610
Sarah Michaels: No, can you show that again gene.

766
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:57.270
Susan Snay: So that's kind of an interesting thing because we've talked we've mentioned genes, but it's a little bit before that.

767
01:19:57.450 --> 01:19:57.870
Okay.

768
01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.980
Susan Snay: So it's separated out a certain part of the DNA, so it wasn't every party was just a little bit of it.

769
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.600
i'll try to catch it real quickly when it goes by.

770
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:15.000
Can out stretching out.

771
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:19.350
Sarah Michaels: There stevie.

772
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.320
Stop.

773
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.210
Jessica Zaleski: Ah.

774
01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:25.200
Ms. B: right there.

775
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:29.580
Susan Snay: So when we look at certain parts of the DNA.

776
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:35.730
Susan Snay: We call certain parts together as a unit of gene and.

777
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:43.650
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, so are you saying like from here, maybe i'm pointing at the double helix but like from here to there is a gene.

778
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.360
Susan Snay: Like the highlighted section that we.

779
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.830
Jessica Zaleski: cannot yeah.

780
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.900
Jessica Zaleski: So so gene is a section of DNA.

781
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:58.200
Sarah Michaels: it's it's hard to believe that could be got to be so small.

782
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:08.310
Jessica Zaleski: I know because think about this, this is what this is what I love about this video I mean think about how small this cell is in your body.

783
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.580
Susan Snay: Can we see those cells, without a microscope.

784
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.330
Leandro Graterol: Do you guys think i'm I think.

785
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:17.220
Reggie: No, no.

786
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.420
Susan Snay: nope nope.

787
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.090
Jessica Zaleski: You got to go inside.

788
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:40.110
Susan Snay: Right we're going inside that small cell that we can't see into an organelles that we really can't see inside that or going out and seeing something even smaller that's even smaller where we stretch it out isn't that mind blowing.

789
01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:45.300
Jessica Zaleski: and totally and look at all the DNA strand that makes up this chromosome.

790
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.630
Sarah Michaels: How long if you stretched it all out would it be.

791
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.400
Sarah Michaels: And that's just one chromosome and we have 23 is that right.

792
01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.180
Sarah Michaels: pears pears 23 pairs.

793
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:04.920
Jessica Zaleski: All right, do we want to stop there missing.

794
01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.400
Susan Snay: yeah so so as you see this now, we can think.

795
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:12.180
Are we getting all of the same.

796
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.410
Leandro Graterol: Genes yeah I was thinking about that.

797
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:25.230
Susan Snay: Oh, so this is making me think about what those rules that you know things that we just came up with and saying this is where, as we get more and more information.

798
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:41.640
Susan Snay: We start thinking about do we need to change, we need to modify our model, we need to change these rules, a little bit from from things that we learned so don't be afraid to to start writing little notes down so that we go back and look at our model, we can make those modifications.

799
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:46.950
Jessica Zaleski: that's a great point so like if if you have an idea as we're going along and you're like oh I don't think that.

800
01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:59.760
Jessica Zaleski: agrees with what we decided jot it down in your notebook because in a little while we're going to go back and say, do we need to change anything from our statements in our model and you'll have that information.

801
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:06.510
Susan Snay: Later, not, these are not our rules as teachers, these are your rules.

802
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:13.170
Susan Snay: Or, as a group, so you need to think about how you want to represent them all right.

803
01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:23.820
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so this is where we're going to do the activity Okay, so in a minute you guys are going to get a Google slide link that will put in the chat.

804
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.290
Jessica Zaleski: When you click on the link it's going to say, do you want to make a copy and you want to click yes copy.

805
01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:43.680
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, and it will open up a slide that looks just like i'm going to show it to you, just like this Okay, but on the sides of the slide it's actually going to have.

806
01:23:44.640 --> 01:24:00.690
Jessica Zaleski: These red and blue lines Okay, and what we want you to do is it says the red and blue lines on your manipulative slide represents the chromosomes have two parents have a species.

807
01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:16.470
Jessica Zaleski: So we're not saying that these are human representing humans it's just any species okay that reproduces this way so REP they represent two parents you're going to separate the chromosomes.

808
01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:26.460
Jessica Zaleski: Which are the red and blue lines into the two parents and line them each up inside the parents.

809
01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:34.770
Jessica Zaleski: On your slide so right here you're not going to do anything with the purple circle, right now, nothing with the purple circle.

810
01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:53.250
Jessica Zaleski: We just want you to figure out over here, where do these lines go do they go in the yellow circles, they go in the blue, how are you going to match them up where these lines go don't put anything in the purple circle you're working in the green and blue circles right now it's green and.

811
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.280
Jessica Zaleski: yellow i'm sorry green and yellow Thank you i'm looking at.

812
01:24:57.510 --> 01:25:02.520
Jessica Zaleski: The Green and yellow circles right now is where you are working.

813
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:06.630
Susan Snay: Can we just show them real quick how to move the chromosomes without changing the size.

814
01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:18.870
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely, so I sometimes you have two options here when you click on this, you can click and hold and drag okay I interrupted up every time I do that yeah So if you.

815
01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:33.300
Jessica Zaleski: If you don't want to click and hold and drag you can click on it, and when you get the blue circle, the top in the blue at the bottom, you can find us the arrows on your keyboard and you can just move it with the arrow so i'm just.

816
01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:34.410
Jessica Zaleski: Sick again controller.

817
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.790
Sarah Michaels: yep exactly.

818
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:42.480
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, yes, like if you're on xbox or ps3 or for whatever it is all right, just like that yeah good job.

819
01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:47.250
Susan Snay: They are different sizes so sometimes if you click on it, you could accidentally change the size.

820
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:53.490
Susan Snay: yeah so no might be better off using the arrows yeah just highlight it and then use the arrow keys to move it around.

821
01:25:54.270 --> 01:26:03.570
Jessica Zaleski: There you go alright so i'm going to put copy this link here, and if we go over.

822
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.370
Reggie: I guess stop sharing way she could pay as much as you want and, like any side right.

823
01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.030
Reggie: yeah it's up to you, shut up all of them on one side.

824
01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.380
Jessica Zaleski: you decide where they.

825
01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:32.370
Jessica Zaleski: Go okay so i'm going to put the directions back up on my screen in a minute, but this is the link you want to use click on that link and when you do it should ask you if you want to make a copy make the copy and then you'll have your own copy to play working fine.

826
01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:41.010
Ms. B: And remember, as you're moving those around you want to remember the rules that you came up with as you're moving them into the circles.

827
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.100
Ms. B: keep those rules in mind.

828
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:02.460
Jessica Zaleski: Eric the rules.

829
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:12.210
Susan Snay: So I think when you make the copy you're just going to have to move the mom and the dad title back over to the circles and then move your chromosomes over also.

830
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.220
Sarah Michaels: To pick one his mom when his dad.

831
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:37.410
Ms. B: So exploring further how parents pass on their chromosomes or DNA the red and blue lines on your manipulative slide.

832
01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:47.550
Ms. B: represent the chromosomes have two parents of a species separate the chromosomes which are those tightly coil DNA into the two parents.

833
01:27:47.850 --> 01:28:03.960
Ms. B: line up the chromosomes of each parent in an organized way inside to ovals on your slide so just remember those rules that you came up with if you throw all of those chromosomes into one side, what does that mean happened with those jeans.

834
01:28:18.690 --> 01:28:23.610
Reggie: We leave me in London up like one long line or like side by side, I do it.

835
01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:25.050
Jessica Zaleski: However, you think.

836
01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:29.100
Susan Snay: It just says in an organized way so.

837
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.990
Ms. B: In an organized way organized.

838
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.840
Ms. B: Whatever your idea of organization is for that.

839
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.740
Ms. B: it's up to you.

840
01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:38.400
Sarah Michaels: But, everything is within the circle right.

841
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:39.330
Susan Snay: Not in the purple.

842
01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:41.160
Ms. B: Just no not in the purple.

843
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:06.030
salam: um so after we're done what would you do.

844
01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:15.540
Jessica Zaleski: Why don't you go ahead and type done in the chat as soon as you're done okay all right, that would be great and then we'll get an idea, so when you're done.

845
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:20.610
Jessica Zaleski: Go ahead and type down in the chat will probably give you another minute or so.

846
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:23.340
Jessica Zaleski: It doesn't help us to monitor.

847
01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:27.450
Susan Snay: If you're using the arrows I was purposely doing the arrows just to see how long it would take.

848

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:18.540
That.

1001
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.730
There you go perfect.

1002
01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:33.690
Susan Snay: Oh you're bringing them over so you can compare them.

1003
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:34.890
Oh OK.

1004
01:44:36.810 --> 01:44:37.290
OK.

1005
01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:41.010
Susan Snay: Are you traded oh you're muted veggie you're muted.

1006
01:44:48.150 --> 01:44:50.520
Reggie: Right okay okay.

1007
01:44:51.090 --> 01:45:00.570
Reggie: So same with like some of these blues or Beethoven to read some other sides there's some of the reds and blues give us to move them over and he's put them side by side.

1008
01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:11.700
Reggie: This one's look so this this right is bigger than these two blues right here, but this blue is bigger than this right, and the one on this side.

1009
01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.020
Jessica Zaleski: So there's something about the.

1010
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:21.240
Jessica Zaleski: The size.

1011
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:27.840
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, that the reds are you're saying the reds are bigger.

1012
01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:30.000
it's hard to see like.

1013
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:40.350
Reggie: i'm not saying that the Reggio bigger with the blues are bigger than, say, like some individual like pieces are bigger than others.

1014
01:45:40.650 --> 01:45:45.720
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so some individual pieces, do you think that that was the that was on purpose.

1015
01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:57.210
Reggie: I think it could have been on purpose or you guys just really like trying to line it up perfectly, but i'm not really sure.

1016
01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.820
Sarah Michaels: i'm curious Elio if, could you share your screen is that possible.

1017
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:08.370
Sarah Michaels: Because you had.

1018
01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:22.050
Sarah Michaels: You had something different from I think everybody else, which is you divided them into reds and blues, but you have the dad you read, can you share that show us and talk, we could look at that.

1019
01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.410
Susan Snay: yeah and the patio said something about.

1020
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:35.100
Sarah Michaels: audiences yeah can you share, are you able to share.

1021
01:46:37.050 --> 01:46:40.620
Susan Snay: This use that little green box at the bottom that says share.

1022
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:20.160
Susan Snay: Okay, so it looks like you have all the reds over there in dad and, if we look at those red chromosomes is there anything that you notice about the red chromosomes compared to those glucose sounds the way you've kind of organized them, are they are they the same.

1023
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:29.640
Jessica Zaleski: Can I ask a quick question because I think Elio might be trying to unmute himself and it's what is the keyboard shortcut to unmute on zoom.

1024
01:47:31.770 --> 01:47:35.910
Ms. B: um it's usually spacebar but you usually have to pre program it.

1025
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:36.840
Ms. B: So you can try.

1026
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:38.190
Ms. B: But I think that.

1027
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:39.930
Jessica Zaleski: If the pre program okay.

1028
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:43.200
Sarah Michaels: Baby did that work Leo can you talk now.

1029
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.270
Ms. B: So, if he hits the space button, it should work.

1030
01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:54.390
Jessica Zaleski: He went he went in and was able to unmute but it's awkward when you're sharing your screen to like be going back and forth, so I could tell he was looking for a way to unmute.

1031
01:47:55.710 --> 01:47:58.710
Susan Snay: Mine on my chromebook I cannot use the spacebar it doesn't work.

1032
01:47:58.740 --> 01:47:59.580
Jessica Zaleski: I can't I can't.

1033
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:06.210
Susan Snay: I just have to move my cursor down to the bottom of the screen and then that black menu pops up that I can click mute.

1034
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:10.560
Ms. B: yeah I had to program it on my chromebook to allow it to do it, unfortunately.

1035
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:11.250
Ms. B: But my rent.

1036
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:14.940
Reggie: space for which should me when I we can you guys hear me yeah.

1037
01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:16.860
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, I just.

1038
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:20.520
Jessica Zaleski: Thought works for me okay that's ellie are you unmuted now.

1039
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:22.170
Jessica Zaleski: yeah perfect.

1040
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.590
Jessica Zaleski: So you went with read for dad and blue.

1041
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:29.370
Jessica Zaleski: For mom.

1042
01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:30.270
yeah.

1043
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:47.640
Sarah Michaels: So ll can I can I ask you to do something similar to what somebody else did you see the two long ones red and blue, could you put them next to each other, so the two reds next to each other and the two blues yeah.

1044
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.230
Eliel Arbelo: Read by side by side.

1045
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:49.860
yeah.

1046
01:48:52.800 --> 01:49:00.540
Sarah Michaels: So our thought was this so yeah so what i'm noticing is those are the same on each side but one is red and one is blue.

1047
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:05.280
Sarah Michaels: that's just a noticing.

1048
01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:05.760
Susan Snay: Have a.

1049
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:10.560
Jessica Zaleski: high.

1050
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:30.810
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so i'm noticing to that, like you, have you know the way you had it set up ll you had these like this long pair of reds right this like con taller pair of reds and a taller pair of blues.

1051
01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:44.280
Jessica Zaleski: And now, were you the way you organized it was there, what were you thinking when you chose to put like like i'm looking at dad for a minute, and you have like this kind of smaller chromosome.

1052
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:53.370
Jessica Zaleski: above a slightly longer chromosome did was there is that just the way you chose to organize it or did you have a reason for choosing that.

1053
01:49:54.570 --> 01:49:58.950
Eliel Arbelo: I don't know I just like went from the biggest and then small down a little bit bigger at that.

1054
01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:00.180
Jessica Zaleski: Okay okay.

1055
01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:07.860
Susan Snay: So the two that you have, in the middle, the ones that are on top of each other, are they the same size.

1056
01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:14.640
Susan Snay: So you just decided to put those two together for for what reason just just.

1057
01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:19.440
Eliel Arbelo: Just save more space like okay okay.

1058
01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.060
Susan Snay: good enough answer yeah.

1059
01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.340
Alright cool.

1060
01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:41.220
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so maybe we should take a look Thank you so much for sharing Elio um mate i'm going to actually go back to the presentation and we're going to take a look at that karaoke night right miss snake yes Okay, so let me.

1061
01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:50.700
Susan Snay: Because then they'll go back and compare after, so this is this will be interesting yeah okay so we're going to look at something called a carry oh type.

1062
01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:59.760
Susan Snay: And what that is is a picture of chromosomes are laid out.

1063
01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:02.610
we're gonna be.

1064
01:51:08.850 --> 01:51:09.390
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

1065
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:24.390
Susan Snay: All right, so when we look at all of the chromosomes that are found in let's say a father and a mother, we see a picture of them all laid out and so there's two pictures that you see here.

1066
01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:42.360
Susan Snay: And you had two circles that you sorted blue and red into those circles to represent the father or the mother, so now let's take a look at these pictures here Okay, one of them is a father and one of them was the mother okay.

1067
01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:48.210
Jessica Zaleski: Now let me say i'm going to ask you a question, because I noticed something very different about this.

1068
01:51:49.230 --> 01:51:56.250
Jessica Zaleski: Like when we were just practicing how many pairs did we have guys how many pairs.

1069
01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.610
Jessica Zaleski: Did we have for mom and dad.

1070
01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:02.940
Jessica Zaleski: pairs is a set of two.

1071
01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.660
Sarah Michaels: So key shannon's showing 60 days, but how many pairs of to yeah.

1072
01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:14.490
Nhi Nguyen (Student): Three you.

1073
01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:22.050
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so we three three pairs for mom and three Paris for dad right, so we had 12 total.

1074
01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:37.320
Jessica Zaleski: And then six and six, and then, if we pair them up because i'm looking at this miss today and i'm seeing how they're like they're paired up they look like they're different sizes like ours, but there's way, more than three pairs in here.

1075
01:52:38.250 --> 01:52:50.010
Susan Snay: Well, were we talking when when we had you students sort these red and blue lines these chromosomes did we say that we were talking about humans as a species.

1076
01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.330
Susan Snay: Did we identify the species, we were talking about.

1077
01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:04.890
Susan Snay: No, no, we didn't say if it was a fish a goldfish a male and a female goldfish or a male and a female human or a male and female dog.

1078
01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:12.060
Jessica Zaleski: So do you are you telling me that humans have a different number of chromosomes than other things.

1079
01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:14.850
it's a possibility.

1080
01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:16.920
Okay.

1081
01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:21.540
Jessica Zaleski: How many pairs of chromosomes do you guys see.

1082
01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:24.240
Jessica Zaleski: On this carrier type here.

1083
01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:26.220
salam: No No nine.

1084
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:30.090
Susan Snay: pairs are two that are together so count.

1085
01:53:30.090 --> 01:53:33.390
Jessica Zaleski: back to the groups of two in each picture.

1086
01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.120
Jessica Zaleski: Can you tell us a little tricky yeah I see this.

1087
01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.290
Jessica Zaleski: Number of trying to.

1088
01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:48.120
salam: Like yeah oh miss you're talking about all of them, I felt like just the first one yeah.

1089
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:58.140
Susan Snay: Oh so you're looking at the first blue box, how many pairs of chromosomes do you see in that first blue box oh that works.

1090
01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:58.980
salam: wanted to.

1091
01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.160
know what makes you think there's 22 and you tell me what you're thinking behind that.

1092
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:11.730
salam: Because the numbers right there shows the tissue.

1093
01:54:13.290 --> 01:54:21.300
Susan Snay: yeah there's a number that says they're counting them right each pair 22 What about that last one I see, I see a last set that's not numbered.

1094
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:27.960
salam: it's like the mom clemson's the XX.

1095
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:30.600
Jessica Zaleski: Is that a pair, though.

1096
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:35.340
salam: This is another pair I didn't think so.

1097
01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.350
Reggie: If that's like where it ends at crimson.

1098
01:54:41.490 --> 01:54:43.680
Reggie: So could be like stopping its counter next day.

1099
01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:47.370
Sarah Michaels: Oh that's an interesting.

1100
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:53.430
Susan Snay: What do you mean like stopping its count to the next set the next set of what are you.

1101
01:54:59.010 --> 01:55:09.600
Ms. B: Do you think there are different types of chromosomes when you look at the picture, or the carrier type, some of them, you see numbers and then you said the other ones, you see letters, do you think that means anything.

1102
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.240
I think slide.

1103
01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:22.320
salam: I think the last one X X doesn't like to present this system on chromosomes.

1104
01:55:23.730 --> 01:55:27.690
Susan Snay: So you think maybe the X X could be a mom mom's chromosomes.

1105
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.170
yeah.

1106
01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:30.630
Susan Snay: Well, maybe we can look at the second.

1107
01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:34.740
Susan Snay: set of them and see if they're the same or different let's so let's take a look at the second set.

1108
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:41.040
Susan Snay: So on the right hand side is another box another carrier type take a look at that.

1109
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:44.790
salam: there's The next point and.

1110
01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.190
Jessica Zaleski: Also you're noticing this X, Y at the end here.

1111
01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:54.270
salam: yeah and I know the ex wife is like that that's chromosomes.

1112
01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:04.260
Susan Snay: What is the so so you're saying that there's a difference between the chromosomes in a dad and a mom.

1113
01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:05.670
salam: yeah.

1114
01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:21.420
Ms. B: Early earlier salon was mentioning that there's x's and y's and it might have to do something with girls and boys she mentioned that, when we were in the other slide so I don't know if she means girls and boys from mom and dad or something else.

1115
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:24.540
salam: So what I think is.

1116
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:35.970
salam: Is it like the X X represent like a demand chromosomes and xyz the dad chromosome, but I think it was like.

1117
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:44.430
salam: X, Y it's like a boy the boy the baby it's a boy, but if it's a bit soccer.

1118
01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:53.250
Jessica Zaleski: So Salaam do you think that this carrier type on this side, right here, do you think that this is a carrier type for a female.

1119
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:57.300
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and this one's a stereotype for a male.

1120
01:56:58.590 --> 01:56:58.860
salam: yeah.

1121
01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:00.300
Sarah Michaels: Any.

1122
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.120
Sarah Michaels: means that her hand up okay.

1123
01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:24.840
Nhi Nguyen (Student): um I have like I know something's like someone mentioned that, like the letter like X X X, Y is like the things you know, like the things to let you know that the jailers people like they have a different letter like um.

1124
01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:29.220
Nhi Nguyen (Student): I remember that they had a laws of letter like that.

1125
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:34.710
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so you think there are lots of letters, but those letters let you know the gender.

1126
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:45.060
Nhi Nguyen (Student): yeah okay like X X like i'm they can have like why why like something I.

1127
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:53.760
salam: Miss even though, if ever present that like a boy and a girl, but what about the fit was like twins.

1128
01:57:55.530 --> 01:58:00.900
salam: Does it like X X X, Y but I don't know if it's like a twins like one girl one theory.

1129
01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:04.320
salam: Or maybe worse.

1130
01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:05.940
Jessica Zaleski: Well let's take a.

1131
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:07.140
Jessica Zaleski: let's take a look here.

1132
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:12.300
Jessica Zaleski: The XX does mean female.

1133
01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:26.280
Jessica Zaleski: In this carrier type and the X, Y does mean mail so Salaam yeah, this is a carrier type for a female and MySpace said, this is what type of species is this here.

1134
01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:32.880
Sarah Michaels: Oh she's pointing to herself her.

1135
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.540
Sarah Michaels: that's.

1136
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:36.840
Jessica Zaleski: Her right there female hurts yeah a few.

1137
01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:39.840
Ms. B: Miss it's not misnamed carry on typing.

1138
01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:40.380
wow.

1139
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:47.940
Jessica Zaleski: yeah So this is the carrier type for a human female.

1140
01:58:49.230 --> 01:58:54.120
Jessica Zaleski: And this is the stereotype for a human male so.

1141
01:58:54.270 --> 01:59:08.430
Susan Snay: So really look at that look at that last circled set of chromosomes that that that last pair So what do you notice about the female chromosomes the X X, what do you notice about them.

1142
01:59:09.330 --> 01:59:11.010
salam: During the same size.

1143
01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:16.530
Susan Snay: Oh, and what about the male chromosomes the X, Y, what do you notice about them.

1144
01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:19.650
salam: So there's one is longer than the other.

1145
01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.710
salam: The other ones SMA why.

1146
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:31.350
Susan Snay: Leo said the same thing one small okay so maybe this might be an interesting time to go check our.

1147
01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:41.940
Susan Snay: Organ organization of chromosomes in our own in your different circles, the red and blue and check to see.

1148
01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:45.810
Jessica Zaleski: What you have absolutely.

1149
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:50.100
Ms. B: Sean put inside of the chat I thought human was 23.

1150
01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:53.100
Jessica Zaleski: Oh okay oh.

1151
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:54.150
So.

1152
01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:57.870
Ms. B: So my question would be.

1153
01:59:58.530 --> 02:00:09.270
Ms. B: Do you think, because there's not a number 23 that that pair that separated is still not counted as one of the groups or pairs of chromosomes.

1154
02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:18.480
Ms. B: Someone mentioned about it, possibly being something different, so we said that those last two might be male and female.

1155
02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:32.070
Ms. B: The other ones, maybe something different those other 22 pairs but the last one, is still a pair do you think that that means that that doesn't add it on as a 23rd pair or does that not count as a pair.

1156
02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:39.870
Ms. B: So how many do you think you have, in total, look at the full carrier type.

1157
02:00:40.050 --> 02:00:43.380
Susan Snay: Of we circled each pair each pair.

1158
02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:55.980
Susan Snay: 123 all right yeah so that last circled pair actually counts as one of the 23.

1159
02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:59.610
Ms. B: Why do you think there's not a number on that last set.

1160
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:07.980
salam: Because this one presents like a female and a male X, Y and X X.

1161
02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:11.310
Ms. B: So does it have something to do with what.

1162
02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:16.290
Ms. B: me said, gender, maybe is that last set have to do with gender.

1163
02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.630
Ms. B: What do you think.

1164
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:20.880
salam: yeah I think so.

1165
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:44.460
Jessica Zaleski: So it's 152, so I think what we should do is what miss me said why don't you go back to your slide now and look at what we've uncovered here, we know that when we have the two chromosomes that are the same link.

1166
02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:49.680
Jessica Zaleski: Those all belong in the female or the mom.

1167
02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:58.980
Jessica Zaleski: And the one the pair that one is shorter than the other, that is male so that belongs with dad.

1168
02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:11.520
Susan Snay: So go back to the slide where you move we organize your chromosomes and see if you want to make any changes, knowing now what we just saw about the.

1169
02:02:13.290 --> 02:02:28.170
Susan Snay: X X chromosomes being the same size in a female and the X, Y chromosomes being two different sizes in the mail so go back and see if you want to make any changes on your red and blue chromosomes.

1170
02:03:04.530 --> 02:03:11.190
Susan Snay: Was anybody having trouble getting back to their slide deck where you can organize and move your chromosomes around.

1171
02:03:13.290 --> 02:03:14.820
want to make sure everybody can get back there.

1172
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:22.470
Sarah Michaels: So if we wanted to switch things up, we could, if we wanted to change.

1173
02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:28.500
Sarah Michaels: Where we put reds and blues and all that stuff we can go okay.

1174
02:03:30.330 --> 02:03:34.350
Jessica Zaleski: Or maybe you want to move your titles around right that's true.

1175
02:03:47.250 --> 02:03:48.630
Jessica Zaleski: hey can you just check the chat.

1176
02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.280
um I think we should probably.

1177
02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:06.420
hold off okay.

1178
02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:20.940
Jessica Zaleski: So, once you guys are done um what we'd like you to do is to share your slide with miss, nay.

1179
02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:33.540
Jessica Zaleski: On you can share it with missing, you can just share it with miss day that's fine that's probably the easiest okay so you're just going to go up and click on the top the button.

1180
02:04:35.130 --> 02:04:37.860
Ms. B: Do you want to share your screen and show them how to do that, just in case.

1181
02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:39.960
Jessica Zaleski: i'm.

1182
02:04:40.290 --> 02:04:41.460
Ms. B: We have enough time for that.

1183
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:42.840
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah yeah.

1184
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:50.130
Sarah Michaels: Let me just make one people to put their names and it'll say copy of chromosome.

1185
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:57.240
Jessica Zaleski: And should that, let me show them exactly what to do, because we want to have more than a copy, so I need to.

1186
02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.000
Stop sharing.

1187
02:05:03.690 --> 02:05:05.310
And I need to click on the link.

1188
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:18.960
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so before, when you go to share it, let me make a copy of this.

1189
02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:24.960
Jessica Zaleski: This is what we'd like you to do.

1190
02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:48.360
Jessica Zaleski: So you guys most I think you all, probably know how to share the document, but before you share it, can you please go up to the title of the document and just where it says copy of can you just change that to your name.

1191
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:50.070
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

1192
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.390
Susan Snay: Here I know which one is from.

1193
02:05:51.420 --> 02:06:11.310
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly so miss me will know whose it is so just change I would change mine to jazz Z chromosome store okay so them how to share with me yep so once I get my name changed up here in the title of the file i'm going to go over to share.

1194
02:06:14.190 --> 02:06:27.780
Jessica Zaleski: And then i'm going to type in snag Oh, as soon as I had asked and look at this so Susan today yep that's me right there and then send okay so everybody that.

1195
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:32.640
Susan Snay: I see I would open up this disease, and I say, Mr Z I don't think you finished this.

1196
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:35.130
Susan Snay: Exactly because you were present.

1197
02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:45.300
Jessica Zaleski: I would need to work on that Okay, but change the name yeah and then share awesome and then add snake.

1198
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:47.880
Jessica Zaleski: And then send.

1199
02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:54.540
Jessica Zaleski: an essay is going to get all these emails saying so, and so shared with her.

1200
02:06:59.610 --> 02:07:01.260
Jessica Zaleski: Does anybody need to see that again.

1201
02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:06.660
Jessica Zaleski: i'm guessing you probably already have some this thing in your email me just double check.

1202
02:07:11.550 --> 02:07:13.740
Jessica Zaleski: I do okay there we go.

1203
02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:25.800
Jessica Zaleski: Excellent so it's yeah it's 158 so we're going to be wrapping up in a minute here, but just make sure you rename that get that shared.

1204
02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:29.400
Susan Snay: Look at that you guys are on quality, look at all of them.

1205
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.910
Ms. B: very efficient your.

1206
02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:34.230
Jessica Zaleski: dog is sleeping again.

1207
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:37.410
Jessica Zaleski: Does your dog just sleep all day.

1208
02:07:39.090 --> 02:07:46.920
Jessica Zaleski: Elio oh here's what i'm missing, I want to see the dog oh there we go oh my.

Jessica Zaleski: Goodness what's your dog's name Elio.

1210
02:07:52.110 --> 02:07:52.800
Susan Snay: you're muted.

1211

Eliel Arbelo: star.

1212
02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:00.210
Jessica Zaleski: star yeah oh God.

1213
02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:03.930
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, my goodness, it looks like a little fox.

Ms. B: It totally does.

1215
02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:13.440
Jessica Zaleski: Alright guys great job today anybody have a problem, sharing their slide.

1216
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:14.400
know.

1217
02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:17.160

Jessica Zaleski: awesome okay very good, very good.

1219
02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:24.480
Susan Snay: Now what we're going to do next class in the purple circle.

1220
02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:27.600
Jessica Zaleski: yeah alright.

1221
02:08:27.630 --> 02:08:38.280
Jessica Zaleski: So now we're going to really test out that model next time all right, everyone Thank you so much for your participation today and have a great rest of the weekend.

1222
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:39.090
Susan Snay: They warm.

1223
02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.490
Leandro Graterol: yeah i've made.

1224
02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:43.710
Savina Allajbej (Student): My.

salam: Good day.

1226
02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:48.570
Sarah Michaels: Everyone.

02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:51.030
Sarah Michaels: bye bye guys are.

1228
02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:51.990

Reggie: For ya.

1232
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.520
Reggie: Okay minds working on.

1233
02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:05.640
Sarah Michaels: zoom and.

1234
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.870
Sarah Michaels: I guess.

1235
02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:15.660
Jessica Zaleski: by Chris.

1236
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:22.320
Susan Snay: I have no problem getting out of Google meet but I get stuck in zoom.

1237
02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.370
Ms. B: I was looking for that leave button and then you click leave and then it's like.

1238
02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.880
Ms. B: Are you sure you want to leave the meeting i'm like I press lead for reason.

1239
02:09:32.130 --> 02:09:36.060
Ms. B: And it's so awkward because you're sitting there like just smiling like click.

1240
02:09:38.850 --> 02:09:39.240
Ms. B: Hoping.

1241
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:40.560
Ms. B: A host will save you.

1242
02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:42.240
Ms. B: The embarrassment and just end.

1243
02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:42.870
The meeting.

1244
02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.800
Sarah Michaels: I thought that was that was really cool.

1245
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:48.030
Ms. B: They did so good.

1246
02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.250
Sarah Michaels: awesome yeah yeah.

1247
02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.990
Jessica Zaleski: I feel like we've hit the time in this where.

1248
02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:02.730
Jessica Zaleski: This is like such a weird thing where it's like how much do we let them continue to just.

1249
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.290
Susan Snay: Go.

1250
02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:08.670
Jessica Zaleski: I don't want I mean I hate flounder kind of has this negative connotation, but you got my job.

1251
02:10:08.850 --> 02:10:10.710
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and how much do we just.

1252
02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:24.270
Jessica Zaleski: Tell them because really some of this they aren't necessarily going to be able to just figure out on their own by what we're presenting like you know I mean Salaam got to the female, but that was prior knowledge, she didn't.

1253
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:28.440
Jessica Zaleski: figure that out by looking at it, because you don't get that from us.

1254
02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:33.750
Jessica Zaleski: know, and so I mean I think it's great like when we can build off of that prior knowledge but.

1255
02:10:33.930 --> 02:10:40.530
Jessica Zaleski: I guess, this is where I get like a little frustrated and i'm afraid they're going to get frustrated because, like.

1256
02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:53.190
Jessica Zaleski: We want them to develop the model, but if we keep going, what do you think what do you, you know, like there's at some point we've we've got to build that information and then, once we present it they've got to put the pieces together.

1257
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.870
Ms. B: Right, so when you're in the class and you guys do the ember model, do you.

1258
02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.140
Ms. B: Like because i'm just trying to figure out I guess the mix of the two because.

1259
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:12.690
Ms. B: It seemed like they weren't really allowing us to build in those pieces like it was really pulling it, but they were dealing with a group of educators so obviously we came with that prior knowledge, but it was still.

1260
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:25.680
Ms. B: A slower methodical process of building it up, because they weren't populating anything so just in contrast with these guys, is it for sake of time that we want to populate that information is that is it the same model like I.

1261
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:29.160
Ms. B: Because like I said, this is, I did the model cars that was it.

1262
02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:44.040
Ms. B: Oh, ideally, I just want to make sure that i'm not giving too much information and allowing them the opportunity to think, but we do know that the kids are going to come at varying levels, some of them will have been exposed to this either in school with us.

1263
02:11:44.250 --> 02:11:47.010
Ms. B: Or if they're coming from other countries, they may have covered this already.

1264
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:53.550
Jessica Zaleski: So he said amber does assume a certain degree of prior knowledge.

1265
02:11:53.580 --> 02:12:02.100
Jessica Zaleski: Going okay like it really back to my my feeling and I feel like our students, some of them have that prior knowledge.

1266
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:04.050
Ms. B: And some of them, some of them don't.

1267
02:12:04.050 --> 02:12:04.620
Jessica Zaleski: don't.

1268
02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:05.910
Jessica Zaleski: know so we could.

1269
02:12:05.970 --> 02:12:16.860
Jessica Zaleski: We could spin our wheels, for a long time on certain things and we're just never and that's when I feel like we start to lose them and as Sue and I have experienced this a lot class like.

1270
02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:29.730
Jessica Zaleski: We don't want to keep there's one thing there's a difference between wanting them to feel free to share their ideas and keep on pushing them for ideas that they don't know how to formulate because they just don't have.

1271
02:12:29.730 --> 02:12:31.800
Jessica Zaleski: Enough background information here right.

1272
02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:36.840
Ms. B: Well, I think, with this session, it was helpful because you had them we work through it.

1273
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:46.680
Ms. B: In hate it stinks when you feel like you're pulling teeth, but I think we gave them the leverage and the freedom to keep building up every single segment, so I think.

1274
02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:55.920
Ms. B: When we transition into the next one, when we continue it's not more so about still building that model we have key ideas that we've settled upon and now here we go.

1275
02:12:56.190 --> 02:12:57.270
Ms. B: yeah because we did.

1276
02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:58.980
Jessica Zaleski: The model building to do it.

1277
02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:01.350
Jessica Zaleski: A model buildings always laborious.

1278
02:13:02.010 --> 02:13:03.270
Jessica Zaleski: And and that's that's fine.

1279
02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:14.910
Jessica Zaleski: But like once we got to the carrier type you know and it's like it's moments like that there, we have to decide, like okay How much are we going to sit here and.

1280
02:13:14.970 --> 02:13:18.900
Ms. B: Or should we have presented it and given them the information to pull all those pieces.

1281
02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:20.550
Jessica Zaleski: Together that's exactly where I think.

1282
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:28.170
Jessica Zaleski: We need to go, like some of it if we just say here's a human character like we can ask what do you notice, you know, and I think it was great all the 22.

1283
02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:29.190
Jessica Zaleski: But like just.

1284
02:13:29.370 --> 02:13:37.050
Jessica Zaleski: Waiting there we I don't think I don't think wait time in instances like that is necessarily beneficial.

1285
02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:43.740
Ms. B: yeah cuz I had no idea i'm like should I just tell them that the last pair is the 23rd period.

1286
02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.120
Ms. B: Right you.

1287
02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:57.690
Jessica Zaleski: know I think I don't think that they would have you know, and then you can see, like even with what reggie said of is that, where it ends and then it goes on like conceptually, despite the fact that we showed them.

1288
02:13:58.290 --> 02:14:03.720
Jessica Zaleski: Where the chromosomes are and that there, though they're independent like you know.

1289
02:14:04.290 --> 02:14:14.130
Jessica Zaleski: Yet they're still not an understanding of that, and this is what like this is where I do get concerned about this is like that they do.

1290
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:34.620
Jessica Zaleski: Have a full conceptual understanding of like Okay, this is a chromosome in the nucleus, I mean not that they're all lined up in a nice little you know they're not like that, but they are distinct you know and in separate, so I think we should go back about a video.

1291
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:35.670
Sarah Michaels: You know what I mean and say.

1292
02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:45.870
Jessica Zaleski: whoa okay so i'm seeing this X saying Okay, what is this mean, how many of these because next time we're going to talk I my favorite chart of all time how many chromosomes.

1293
02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:48.240
Jessica Zaleski: Do the different organisms have.

1294
02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:49.260
Ms. B: Oh boy.

1295
02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:59.580
Jessica Zaleski: or mines get blown it slide number 24 when you find out like you have more in common with a banana than like genetically then like you know, a dog or something.

1296
02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:00.090
Jessica Zaleski: But.

1297
02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:03.150
Ms. B: They start asking about double x's and.

1298
02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:03.720
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah.

1299
02:15:04.230 --> 02:15:05.010
Jessica Zaleski: yeah well yeah.

1300
02:15:05.550 --> 02:15:23.010
Sarah Michaels: So, so one thing I want to say is I thought the video was really great, and when you first go into the nucleus you and you see a chromosome in the background, you can see, others, but so now, I think, if you showed them that again.

1301
02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:33.870
Sarah Michaels: And you froze it right there, you said you can see other chromosomes remember that carrier type they're all 23 in there somewhere.

1302
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:53.700
Sarah Michaels: But they're floating you know, and this is one, and so what their two little sticks was that thing together, and so I think they're putting they're getting it from multiple and just having played around themselves, maybe I mean, I agree with you that.

1303
02:15:54.810 --> 02:15:56.850
Sarah Michaels: Some of that you know, are there.

1304
02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:15.450
Sarah Michaels: Tell us, maybe, or you know some of that is is kind of makes a, but I think you guys I think today was a really interesting example of how they did I mean that initial model that really was their word.

1305
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:37.560
Sarah Michaels: worked really well the very best you know make they said those things there and then the massaging of it Okay, and now they have more, and so I thought I thought this the trust the process today really worked yeah.

1306
02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:40.890
Jessica Zaleski: But I was far less massaging I think so.

1307
02:16:41.010 --> 02:16:42.960
Jessica Zaleski: than we've ever had to do yeah.

1308
02:16:42.990 --> 02:17:04.320
Jessica Zaleski: On an initial model, our last our last word smithing far less at you know I mean because really there were, I think there was one word that we added that they didn't actually come up with when it was like genes create or gene like plan and we changed it, but that was it.

1309
02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.100
Jessica Zaleski: Whereas in the past there have been times, where Sue and I like basically.

1310
02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:09.270
Jessica Zaleski: have to read.

1311
02:17:10.410 --> 02:17:11.910
Jessica Zaleski: Everything and then it's.

1312
02:17:11.970 --> 02:17:16.110
Jessica Zaleski: kind of get them to buy in it's not as effective, but this was much better.

1313
02:17:16.350 --> 02:17:28.950
Sarah Michaels: So, it means that they're they're drawing on resources from within the group, but I think they all feel like Okay, this is our methods they're, the ones who didn't know like a key Sean knows more.

1314
02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:38.970
Sarah Michaels: And he puts it in when he can and but then everybody gets it from him as whatnot, but you have put in information what is a chromosome.

1315
02:17:40.410 --> 02:17:51.750
Sarah Michaels: you've shown the video so you're seeing the territory you've shown the carrier type you've shown the X, Y and X X, so it feels kind of interesting.

1316
02:17:52.080 --> 02:18:10.800
Sarah Michaels: Where there is really information new information that now everyone should get and the ones who did red blue red blue red blue that's Okay, but they should see now I mean that's the thing do that does everyone get that it's read read read read read read.

1317
02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:12.150
Jessica Zaleski: out because.

1318
02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:27.210
Ms. B: I got them and if they don't, then I mean that's something we're now that they have their ability to work through the model manipulate revise with the new informant ation now we can present them with the misconception clear ups.

1319
02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:31.080
Sarah Michaels: Yes, in a sense it isn't red and blue.

1320
02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:32.610
Susan Snay: It can be re.

1321
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:33.180
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1322
02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:42.150
Sarah Michaels: But yeah same, for you know one person has theirs, and another person has theirs and that's what we were showing.

1323
02:18:42.510 --> 02:18:57.330
Sarah Michaels: The red and the blue it's not a combination of two people were showing one person's but then we will show a combination down, you know that I think I guess I feel like conceptually this is strong.

1324
02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:08.340
Ms. B: I think they i'm surprised, they got that far along with clearing up a lot of the uncertainty, by the time we got to the end it's like Oh, we just need five more minutes, and we can bring it home.

1325
02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:18.090
Ms. B: Like you just sound like i'll just five just five minutes, so I mean thinking of how long it takes to cover this unit with a class and think in literally.

1326
02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:36.360
Ms. B: 1.5 sessions, not even a full point five, they got this far, like, I think it went fairly well considering, but now it's time to clear up the misconceptions and kind of gives them what the idea is so they don't still have those ideas floating in their mind that it's something contradictory.

1327
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:38.040
Sarah Michaels: Could articulate.

1328
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:40.320
Ms. B: What it is we can come to.

1329
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:41.220
Sarah Michaels: And so I.

1330
02:19:41.730 --> 02:19:45.210
Susan Snay: put my my my labels incorrectly on mine.

1331
02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:49.380
Sarah Michaels: yeah first and then I but yeah somebody.

1332
02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:53.610
Susan Snay: You know what what do they think about my my diagram right.

1333
02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:04.890
Sarah Michaels: You know the um the way they did it and we didn't use it and that's totally fine, I think this worked really, really well where everyone is working on in a small group.

1334
02:20:06.210 --> 02:20:11.880
Sarah Michaels: A version and you've got the same slide and then people can see each other's that might.

1335
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:18.060
Sarah Michaels: Because they couldn't see well they shared it worked out, but anyway.

1336
02:20:18.690 --> 02:20:19.980
Ms. B: I think you could do that for the.

1337
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:22.380
Ms. B: I mean whenever the baby I have for the baby.

1338
02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:28.650
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, God, I was just thinking like maybe we plan to start the next session with.

1339
02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:36.570
Jessica Zaleski: let's talk about the mom and the dad we noticed that the moms that that smallest set of chromosomes on mom.

1340
02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:47.190
Jessica Zaleski: They should be the same length, based on the stereotype that we saw those should be female and the mail should have one larger than the other in that fat okay.

1341
02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:59.520
Jessica Zaleski: So then, instead of giving them each their own new set we figure out the breakout breakout rooms in advance, they share a slide so they're all going into the same one, and they have to agree.

1342
02:20:59.550 --> 02:21:01.650
Ms. B: and agree how to make a baby.

1343
02:21:01.890 --> 02:21:03.930
Jessica Zaleski: And I think a lot of misconceptions will get.

1344
02:21:03.930 --> 02:21:04.530
Jessica Zaleski: cleared up.

1345
02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:08.340
Jessica Zaleski: And they'll be teaching each other, you know that's right.

1346
02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:09.030
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

1347
02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:10.260
Ms. B: I think that'd be awesome.

1348
02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:24.120
Sarah Michaels: And to your question just about what is this about letting them, you know I think those are good questions to raise, because I think there, there are moments when you definitely want to tell.

1349
02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:38.850
Sarah Michaels: And there are moments when you want to get them to help constructed and it's really important, I think, in general, for teachers to know the difference with ember because I think you can really waste a lot of time.

1350
02:21:38.850 --> 02:21:40.410
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, and yeah and.

1351
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:42.180
Ms. B: Definitely, can you don't want them.

1352
02:21:42.210 --> 02:21:43.410
Susan Snay: going off in.

1353
02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:55.290
Jessica Zaleski: And it can be that I, it can be detrimental for the English learners because sometimes they hear an idea, and if someone's confident and we just say I don't know they will attach that in their mind as.

1354
02:21:55.770 --> 02:22:06.030
Jessica Zaleski: You know, a fact, and if we don't go back and clear it up very explicitly later they're walking away I think that's been one real struggle with amber is.

1355
02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:16.590
Jessica Zaleski: Because of all the sharing and sometimes again based on where they are auditory you know processing, for you know their comprehension is at that point they're hearing.

1356
02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:33.390
Jessica Zaleski: An understanding bits and pieces right, and then they may be missing out on key like when we really established something so I think of like Salaam Salaam like in class and I feel like she's a little bit more back to well she's a lot more backed off now than she is.

1357
02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:49.980
Jessica Zaleski: Last, let me tell you, but she is adamant and very you know that she has the answers in class, you know and very confident and she can be completely off base and so it's like you it's like how much air time do we give yeah.

1358
02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:56.190
Ms. B: And that's why I keep trying to write down the things that she says so I can go back to the factual X.

1359
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:57.900
Ms. B: rays of what she says.

1360
02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:03.210
Ms. B: and bring them back and have left on those like these are facts you presented, I don't know about the other stuff.

1361
02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:07.440
Jessica Zaleski: But, but the like these are the caveats you know what I need.

1362
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:09.570
Jessica Zaleski: To be aware of with this.

1363
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:18.780
Sarah Michaels: yeah mom and I think we've got to keep writing about it are talking about it because other teachers will use ember and will you'll have to.

1364
02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:27.120
Sarah Michaels: you'll have to talk about this dilemma, and maybe we want to get back with Cindy and Chris and Jen at some point and say look.

1365
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:35.970
Sarah Michaels: let's talk about this challenge, especially within English learners and see what we can come to together but.

1366
02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:50.520
Sarah Michaels: I do think in that initial model that was very impressive and I think increasingly as we correct it, we should get those kids saying it reading it talking, you know owning those.

1367
02:23:50.940 --> 02:24:00.360
Sarah Michaels: ideas and i'm wondering if we should do one in Spanish, and one in Portuguese, because it seems like I mean there's Leandro and there's.

1368
02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:11.790
Sarah Michaels: kaplan who, I wonder, I mean i'm just wondering if it's so important that they really understand this would it help that they have a copy and in both languages or not.

1369
02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:13.140
Ms. B: I don't know, I think it would make.

1370
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:20.250
Ms. B: It would make sense, because, like even when I was preparing for em costs, like my whole review guide I printed out in five different languages, had to have.

1371
02:24:20.490 --> 02:24:24.270
Ms. B: People translate it because they said I can read it in English, but it doesn't.

1372
02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:28.800
Ms. B: frame it in my mind, but when I read it in my language, it made sense, and I could compare it.

1373
02:24:29.010 --> 02:24:39.030
Ms. B: And I mean interestingly enough, having that correlation they were passing em cast the first time, like the other kids, so I think, giving them that extra edge or that opportunity would definitely be very beneficial.

1374
02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:45.120
Sarah Michaels: So should we ask them to translate it, because then we could ask Salaam to do it in Arabic.

1375
02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:46.770
Ms. B: We couldn't tell them no homework.

1376
02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.000
Sarah Michaels: Okay, so.

1377
02:24:48.690 --> 02:24:49.170
Sarah Michaels: You should.

1378
02:24:51.210 --> 02:24:51.480
Ms. B: Watch.

1379
02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:53.760
Jessica Zaleski: And do we wait.

1380
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:56.310
Jessica Zaleski: Until we do a revision, on the model.

1381
02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:57.690
Jessica Zaleski: More we translate.

1382
02:24:57.810 --> 02:25:02.850
Jessica Zaleski: Because we have some some major ambiguities in there some things that really don't.

1383
02:25:02.850 --> 02:25:12.990
Jessica Zaleski: Speak to how I mean i'm very impressed with it, but there's some redundancy, there are some things that I think even now, if we had had time they'd go back and say, oh no, no, no, this is a.

1384
02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:18.030
Sarah Michaels: let's wordsmith it with them and then we'll say and here's it Spanish English and.

1385
02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:31.530
Sarah Michaels: it'd be great to have it now bamian and but we don't have those capacities, right now, if you guys want to make one that would be awesome will publish it but yeah let's do it gradually as we get more to this time.

1386
02:25:32.250 --> 02:25:43.410
Jessica Zaleski: And we're going to start hopefully next it'll definitely be next weekend adding in some of the more scientific vocabulary to it because, again we're still talking about you know something like an egg.

1387
02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:46.260
Jessica Zaleski: Coming from the father and the other thing like.

1388
02:25:46.410 --> 02:26:00.840
Jessica Zaleski: conceptually I don't think that they have a clue they have not put together, certainly not all of them Okay, is this is this and every cell that you know, is this in certain set like How is this hat like where you know.

1389
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:03.480
Ms. B: What have you guys already covered human body systems.

1390
02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:03.840
Ms. B: No.

1391
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.270
Jessica Zaleski: No, not do the reproductive system.

1392
02:26:06.510 --> 02:26:16.680
Ms. B: You know I thought he was gonna say I thought that came out of the frameworks, with the new switching things so i'm like their misconceptions meet and they don't have a picture to kind of put it.

1393
02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.370
Ms. B: Exactly exactly who's going to elongate the model because that.

1394
02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:22.560
Ms. B: Has anything to point exactly.

1395
02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:24.810
Susan Snay: What about plants.

1396
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:27.570
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and insects right, I mean yeah.

1397
02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:29.310
Susan Snay: So.

1398
02:26:29.610 --> 02:26:33.510
Ms. B: You don't have anything to compare it against I mean you're just pulling from left field and.

1399
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.870
Susan Snay: like it.

1400
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:36.540
Susan Snay: wasn't bad for left field.

1401
02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:40.950
Ms. B: yeah they did really good for left field i'm like your tree has some real knowledge on.

1402
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:44.820
Ms. B: A funds of knowledge in that tree are pretty in depth.

1403
02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:49.890
Ms. B: Because without having covered it they're definitely pulling out some pretty factual information yeah.

1404
02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:52.440
Anisha Hassan: You did right sperm in the chat.

1405
02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:56.130
Jessica Zaleski: And Sabina said spur matters oh yes.

1406
02:26:56.250 --> 02:26:57.420
Ms. B: That is or yesterday.

1407
02:26:57.420 --> 02:26:57.870
Jessica Zaleski: Was that.

1408
02:26:57.930 --> 02:26:58.920
Jessica Zaleski: term yesterday.

1409
02:26:59.190 --> 02:27:10.830
Sarah Michaels: it's kind of cool because it's it's emergent but it's not like overly I mean I just feel like something really positive is happening right now, and I think.

1410
02:27:10.890 --> 02:27:19.830
Jessica Zaleski: more of them know those terms, but when we were asking yesterday, how do the trains get past they are thinking of the intercourse and they.

1411
02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:23.250
Jessica Zaleski: don't want they don't want to talk about it because it's super awkward.

1412
02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:34.110
Jessica Zaleski: Whereas like no we're talking about like on the cellular level, and now I think they'll understand that and those vocabulary words will start to come up more freely, because they don't need to talk about the anatomy of it.

1413
02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:39.390
Jessica Zaleski: You know they're just talking about the actual biology of it, so I think.

1414
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:40.650
Ms. B: yeah definitely.

1415
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:42.090
Ms. B: cuz.

1416
02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:44.610
Ms. B: i'm like oh i'm like reggie your eyes.

1417
02:27:44.610 --> 02:27:45.450
Ms. B: yeah left.

1418
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:47.400
Ms. B: No like no.

1419
02:27:47.490 --> 02:27:48.600
Jessica Zaleski: PG 13 yeah.

1420
02:27:48.960 --> 02:28:01.830
Ms. B: I have to just want one other part that um do you think we should put terms to those things where they're talking about the genes in the traits the physical behavior like the genotype phenotype because I think they mix them together and they think.

1421
02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:07.260
Ms. B: I mean the gene is a characteristic, but I think they have them as one in the same.

1422
02:28:07.530 --> 02:28:09.630
Jessica Zaleski: room number doesn't introduce those and you.

1423
02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:11.010
Jessica Zaleski: don't icicle genetics it's.

1424
02:28:11.010 --> 02:28:11.370
Jessica Zaleski: Not in.

1425
02:28:11.850 --> 02:28:12.870
Jessica Zaleski: My office at all.

1426
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:16.230
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, oh it'll be great if we get into.

1427
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:23.790
Jessica Zaleski: Some of that like I I mean, realistically speaking, given where we are and where we need to go we're not going to fit it, I mean.

1428
02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:33.600
Jessica Zaleski: I don't think we're going to finish meiosis next weekend which means if it carries over and tried it we've still got to do the DNA what's going on with that we have any idea what's going.

1429
02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:40.590
Anisha Hassan: On did Sarah send us an email about the toolkits that I did not really completely, but I will take.

1430
02:28:41.370 --> 02:28:42.000
Ms. B: away.

1431
02:28:42.090 --> 02:28:43.530
Anisha Hassan: What happened there.

1432
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:49.200
Anisha Hassan: I don't email about the toolkits that I should have read before.

1433
02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:51.300
Anisha Hassan: But you know.

1434
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:54.180
Susan Snay: Our by our in my life, right now, so I don't.

1435
02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:55.470
Jessica Zaleski: I know seriously and.

1436
02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.510
Ms. B: Why is there something wrong with the toolkits.

1437
02:28:57.570 --> 02:29:07.770
Anisha Hassan: No, no, we we I think do it was an order or something, and we were still waiting on them, but Sarah send us a link here's the link to the chromosome get the.

1438
02:29:07.770 --> 02:29:09.030
Jessica Zaleski: No, no, no.

1439
02:29:09.090 --> 02:29:11.760
Jessica Zaleski: Those are that sorry, those are the slide deck chromosome.

1440
02:29:12.390 --> 02:29:15.420
Jessica Zaleski: Okay that's what I was thinking i'm like i've got an aegis thinking.

1441
02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:16.440
Anisha Hassan: About yeah.

1442
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:27.720
Jessica Zaleski: I I said to sue knowing how slow things are in the western public schools with ordering I don't think there's a chance in the world that we're going to get these kits and time for the end of this.

1443
02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:43.320
Ms. B: Is that is that the extraction one yeah well, I mean I did I didn't add, I have a protocol for a home based one I mean all it is is soap and water or detergent 70% alcohol and a want to pull it out.

1444
02:29:43.770 --> 02:29:45.150
Susan Snay: i've done it in my kitchen too.

1445
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:46.380
Ms. B: yeah like I just.

1446
02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:58.230
Ms. B: I just didn't I just did it yesterday with the kids i'm like we're going to do on the fly DNA extraction lab do you have this this this and this and the people like I don't have it i'm like well you're going to do this lab and we had like.

1447
02:29:58.620 --> 02:30:07.440
Ms. B: It was crazy just pulling random things I was like well, you have a sharpie right do you have a piece of paper well we're going to do, paper chromatography grab for sharpies.

1448
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:15.540
Ms. B: Random stuff but like if the kid doesn't come in, if we I think if we tell them before the last.

1449
02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:27.480
Ms. B: thing i'm sure someone was talking about she's all about nails so i'm sure she has some alcohol based something I mean we can ask him and see if they have it, but I mean they're all home base supplies you don't really need.

1450
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:32.010
Anisha Hassan: I mean just be a position where we could just like I think I get asked there and.

1451
02:30:32.610 --> 02:30:33.810
Jessica Zaleski: It doesn't work at the asset.

1452
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:35.250
Ms. B: Know acetone.

1453
02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:36.240
Ms. B: wow mom.

1454
02:30:36.450 --> 02:30:44.970
Ms. B: Even like set like 70% rubbing alcohol works fine to pull it and a lot of people have in their house for sterile ins and disinfectants, I mean.

1455
02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:47.970
Jessica Zaleski: So what about the strips What are those for.

1456
02:30:49.470 --> 02:30:53.250
Jessica Zaleski: What do you mean the strips strips that you sent home in the science kit the little.

1457
02:30:53.250 --> 02:30:55.560
Ms. B: Paper all the PTC taste or paper.

1458
02:30:55.650 --> 02:30:59.040
Susan Snay: yeah we do have that in there, so that's that's something that's in there.

1459
02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:09.120
Ms. B: I mean you can do that, to see if there are taste or non taste or do do you want to go into a pundit square for it or pedigree I mean pedigree may be a little bit more advanced but I mean you could do.

1460
02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:23.370
Ms. B: Since they have the X is now X X X, Y and all that stuff you could probably do a PTC taste, or if they have the strips I think it would just be if anything else, even if we don't get that far, it would be just nice to see their reactions when they put them in their mouth.

1461
02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:24.690
Susan Snay: yeah I know.

1462
02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:32.130
Ms. B: If nothing else, I mean you don't have to go into a whole theory behind it either, you are a taster or you're not a taster.

1463
02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:37.500
Susan Snay: I wonder how we can even find out where in this order process the DNA kits are.

1464
02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:41.610
Jessica Zaleski: So maybe an ISA if you can ask Sarah to follow up on that.

1465
02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:50.220
Susan Snay: Because they had to go through that specific gentleman that I don't know and he said he was going to try to push it through on his end.

1466
02:31:50.370 --> 02:31:57.510
Ms. B: But I mean If not, what they let me go to the dollar store and buy 20 bottles of 70% alcohol and drop them up like this goes with your kid.

1467
02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:03.360
Anisha Hassan: I think that's probably really possible like yes he's really good at.

1468
02:32:03.690 --> 02:32:05.220
Ms. B: The dollar store yeah.

1469
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:15.390
Anisha Hassan: I did something in my science fair like what you're talking about and use my like okay I use my own spirits and like we're asking people to do DNA extraction.

1470
02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:21.090
Ms. B: Oh yeah we have that and we i'm like if you're at home, you can definitely do your cheek swab but i'm definitely not doing it in school.

1471
02:32:21.330 --> 02:32:23.100
Susan Snay: yeah now.

1472
02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:27.930
Anisha Hassan: yeah and then even though it's kind of gross.

1473
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:33.360
Ms. B: But I mean but otherwise I mean it would be more driving around I mean I could go.

1474
02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:40.440
Ms. B: grab the alcohol at some point, and put them in a carnival tube and have them run through the experiment and then go and collect them.

1475
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:56.640
Ms. B: Because, are they going to go through the proper i'm getting rid of your chemicals nobody's going to want to do all that, so I know drop them off for the procedure and then pick them up have them put them in a little ziploc bag so give them to him in a little ziploc bag.

1476
02:32:57.090 --> 02:32:59.610
Susan Snay: What do you i'm not sure what why, would you be collecting it.

1477
02:33:00.540 --> 02:33:06.300
Ms. B: Oh up because technically we're not supposed to be giving them any type of chemicals or media so.

1478
02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:12.990
Ms. B: me personally versus the school ordering it in a kit I mean they're the liability with that, but me, giving them.

1479
02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:25.350
Ms. B: I mean I don't i'm fine with it, but I know, there was a whole issue about it with even for the biotech kids me, giving them a pre made kid they're like you can give them supplies, but you can't give them any type of media.

1480
02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:28.770
Jessica Zaleski: So if they like the alcohol on fire and burn their house down.

1481
02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:29.760
Ms. B: it's my fault.

1482
02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:31.590
Ms. B: Exactly it's my fault.

1483
02:33:32.850 --> 02:33:33.180
Anisha Hassan: lead.

1484
02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:36.450
Anisha Hassan: Up to them drinking it because that's what our.

1485
02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:39.450
Anisha Hassan: instructor was like don't drink it it's.

1486
02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:41.130
Jessica Zaleski: Not well that's entirely possible.

1487
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:47.820
Ms. B: Well, believe me, one of the students in my lab is like we don't have 70% alcohol, but my dad said I can use 100 proof.

1488
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:48.570
Baba.

1489
02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:52.470
Ms. B: I was like whoa okay.

1490
02:33:54.690 --> 02:33:55.350
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

1491
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:57.150
Susan Snay: Well, maybe what we do is we.

1492
02:33:57.150 --> 02:34:05.010
Jessica Zaleski: See how far we got on Friday, you know, like let's maybe regroup and then say let's see where we are realistically.

1493
02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:15.510
Susan Snay: You know, we could do two is, we could always say, those of you that have this on hand could follow along and we could do it like as a DEMO.

1494
02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.670
Susan Snay: With what we have.

1495
02:34:17.730 --> 02:34:27.900
Jessica Zaleski: Well, we could tell them we're going to do, and if you can get this stuff by this date, you know I mean if it's what it's dish so rubbing alcohol What else do they need to shine.

1496
02:34:28.410 --> 02:34:34.080
Ms. B: So just so rubbing alcohol something to I guess strain with and probably like a fruit yeah.

1497
02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:51.690
Ms. B: yeah it's very, very, very, very simple stuff someone the we just did it, and I mean there were like can I use a celery can I use this can I use that i'm like go ahead, I mean interestingly enough, the only one that yielded a large amount of DNA is still the strawberry but.

1498
02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:56.280
Jessica Zaleski: So how do you exam What do you do once you extract it.

1499
02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:02.760
Ms. B: So you'll actually see the the DNA coiling up right inside of the alcohol like it looks like a bunch of snot.

1500
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.360
Susan Snay: looks like.

1501
02:35:03.390 --> 02:35:03.810
Ms. B: And then.

1502
02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:14.070
Ms. B: It looks like boogers and then you actually you can take a straw, or you could take rod or something, and you can pull the DNA and it looks like just out of cotton candy like.

1503
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:16.260
Ms. B: Smart like cotton candy.

1504
02:35:16.470 --> 02:35:18.300
Ms. B: Word yes.

1505
02:35:18.330 --> 02:35:20.010
Ms. B: cool it's really cool.

1506
02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:28.020
Jessica Zaleski: So I totally think that we should tell the kids to try to get this back and whoever can do what does that, because this would be amazing.

1507
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:41.580
Ms. B: I think they I think they would totally enjoy it, even if they don't get the whole theory behind it, they know its DNA they know it's just be like well now that we've pulled this DNA out is that the sweetest strawberry you ever tasted let's see if we could make more that too so.

1508
02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:44.940
Susan Snay: They can't see the DNA.

1509
02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:46.080
Ms. B: They can't they.

1510
02:35:46.290 --> 02:35:51.930
Susan Snay: follow this practice procedure and actually separate out in the little glass or.

1511
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:54.330
Ms. B: yeah you watch it actually separating out and you.

1512
02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:55.230
Susan Snay: can go and.

1513
02:35:55.620 --> 02:35:58.320
Jessica Zaleski: Just do it and, like a drinking glass that you have or something.

1514
02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:01.590
Susan Snay: Like a laugh.

1515
02:36:01.890 --> 02:36:03.300
Jessica Zaleski: And I know what I just.

1516
02:36:03.450 --> 02:36:06.360
Jessica Zaleski: I just went to the grocery store I got all kinds of fruit my fresh.

1517
02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:09.060
Jessica Zaleski: fruits could be family activity and I.

1518
02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:15.870
Ms. B: want you next thing we'll just we'll be telling us well I pulled the DNA and I started measuring it and I made a graph to.

1519
02:36:19.710 --> 02:36:30.570
Jessica Zaleski: All right, alright, so this is exciting, so I totally think we should mention I mean if something if we don't get an update on the status of the kits by Friday I think we need to mention this to them that next weekend.

1520
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:46.140
Jessica Zaleski: As part of our final vsp weekend, we want to do this activity with you, so if you're out at dollar tree or walmart or wherever grocery store and you can get or if you don't already have it some dish soap and you know, whatever they need.

1521
02:36:46.170 --> 02:36:47.550
Susan Snay: rubbing alcohol is the thing.

1522
02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:47.970
Ms. B: The main.

1523
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.680
Ms. B: rubbing alcohol is the main thing.

1524
02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:56.280
Ms. B: Someone said Oh well, I did bleach i'm like, why did you think bleach would work.

1525
02:36:57.420 --> 02:36:57.960
Ms. B: telling me.

1526
02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:00.240
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, I mean.

1527
02:37:00.990 --> 02:37:01.950
Susan Snay: Because it's the same.

1528
02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:03.300
Ms. B: it's the same thing right.

1529
02:37:04.350 --> 02:37:05.580
Ms. B: horse horse.

1530
02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:10.110
Jessica Zaleski: Certain leader of our country did tell people to drink lysol so I mean.

1531
02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:11.580
Jessica Zaleski: You know, like.

1532
02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:13.770
Ms. B: My big fat Greek wedding.

1533
02:37:13.770 --> 02:37:14.490
lysol.

1534
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:17.250
Jessica Zaleski: Right.

1535
02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:18.480
Was it windex yeah.

1536
02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:21.180
Ms. B: You gotta works.

1537
02:37:23.490 --> 02:37:25.650
Ms. B: So I can understand why they bought right in.

1538
02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:26.040
yeah.

1539
02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:38.580
Anisha Hassan: um Okay, so I made some groups, so it would be more equal just wanted to check with you guys if duking it work so it's soo solanki Sean and me.
