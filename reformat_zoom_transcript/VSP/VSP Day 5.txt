256
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.750

265
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:51.750

Jessica Zaleski: Okay, we looking good.

365
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:57.750
Jessica Zaleski: All right, so all of you had moved the red and blue chromosomes into the circles and indicated, who was mom and who was dad and what we want you to do right now Okay, is now that you have the parents figured out.

366
00:27:59.220 --> 00:27:59.730
Jessica Zaleski: Sorry.

367
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:12.330
Jessica Zaleski: We want you to figure out how to make a viable baby Can someone tell us what they think viable means like what's a viable baby, what do you think.

368
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:22.980
Like I guess.

369
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.560
Susan Snay: A viable.

370
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:46.410
Jessica Zaleski: Agenda okay Sean said living yeah yeah able to live okay um so go back to your chromosome kit decide what chromosomes the parents will give the baby and place them in the purple circle.

371
00:28:47.250 --> 00:29:01.590
Jessica Zaleski: So, think about the rules we've been talking about what we've been learning which chromosomes will the parents, give the baby put those chromosomes in the purple circle, so that purple circle is representing a baby.

372
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:17.250
Sarah Michaels: Can I just ask a quick question has everyone, have we established the red versus the blue and that kind of stuff is it clear to everybody, how to do that did I forget that we did that.

373
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:25.440
Jessica Zaleski: We talked about it, but I think we were going to do this quickly and then.

374
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:26.130
Jessica Zaleski: Talk about.

375
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:35.460
Jessica Zaleski: Why, you know what I mean okay after this so we're just giving you guys like one minute or so, to move those chromosomes.

376
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.240
Sarah Michaels: and

377
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.320

To just take your.

381
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:53.100
Susan Snay: yeah so take your best guess at what what you can do with the mom and the dad chromosomes and make a viable baby in the purple circle.

382
00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:01.560
You see ya.

383
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.190
salam: It depends like on the gender.

384
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: All we said was viable so.

388
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:38.520
Jessica Zaleski: you're moving okay so Uli years weren't on you don't have the red and the blue in the circles yet so you just kind of hold that you lean we want you to just watch Okay, and when students present you'll understand more what to do, Okay, but when you think you have a baby a viable baby.

389
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.010
Jessica Zaleski: Type down in the chat.

390
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.490

391
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:59.400
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe Uli while she's waiting can just try to separate them into the mom and dad like she thinks they belong wow and see if you can get a head start.

392
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.150
Susan Snay: Just try to separate the chromosomes you have into the mom and dad Julie.

393
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.900
And then you'll see everybody else's when they.

Jessica Zaleski: hmm OK, so the two reds are not the same size.

437
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.360

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.220

Jessica Zaleski: Does anyone have anyone want to share it they agree or disagree with.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.020
Jessica Zaleski: This model that reggie shared with us.

444
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.100
Leandro Graterol: And so.

445
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.260

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.760
Okay.

448
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:48.600
Susan Snay: i'm sure everybody has something that's a little bit different, and when you put all of your chromosomes into that purple baby, you probably thought you were right.

449
00:35:49.080 --> 00:36:02.910
Susan Snay: So we're not saying that reggie's right or reggie's wrong we're just looking at what he thinks is a viable offspring a baby and we're just asking you to comment on it yeah or share, maybe, something that you have.

450
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:22.620
Jessica Zaleski: And we can we can disagree completely respectfully and give our ideas, because if we have a different idea than we are disagreeing it doesn't mean it's a bad thing it just means we have a different idea okay did anybody have something very similar to this are exactly the same.

451
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.260
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so Salaam had different.

452
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.060
Edwin Bermejo: is similar.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.460
Jessica Zaleski: You had similar Edwin okay.

454
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:46.620
Susan Snay: So it's you said when you said it's similar so if something was not exactly the same what what was a little bit different in yours.

455
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:50.490
Edwin Bermejo: I put one more the mom and the baby.

456
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.740
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so.

457
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.370
Jessica Zaleski: Which one of the mom did you put in the baby.

458
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.530
Edwin Bermejo: Blue blue.

500
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.900
salam: yeah the tools may read.

501

Jessica Zaleski: All right.

503
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:27.690
Jessica Zaleski: Did anybody have so we had some people that had for chromosomes in the baby some people that had five chromosomes and the baby I haven't heard from anybody who had a number, other than that did anybody have a different number than four or five chromosomes in the baby.

504
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.350
Jessica Zaleski: Okay Sean did sex okay.

505

507
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.100
Susan Snay: dad large dad medium and dad small.

508
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:08.280

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.840
Jessica Zaleski: They were the same size.

515
00:41:59.010 --> 00:41:59.820
Jessica Zaleski: So, like this.

516
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.550

521
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.920
Keyshawn: And I saw my screen, please.

522
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.610
Jessica Zaleski: door that would be great let me stop there will be a lot easier.

523
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.780
Jessica Zaleski: I should have thought of that.

524
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.360
Jessica Zaleski: Good job key Sean.

525
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.690
All right.

526
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.180
Okay.

527
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.260
Jessica Zaleski: So okay so you've got six okay.

528
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.900
interesting.

529
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:05.730
Jessica Zaleski: So mom started with six dad started with six baby had six in key sean's model.

530
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:13.230
Jessica Zaleski: Did anybody have so we've got a four we've got a five we go to six does anybody have anything different than that.

531
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.210
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you Sean.

532
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.340
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so maybe we should take a look here.

533
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:32.610
salam: Like the blues next to each other in the red next to each other.

534
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:38.400
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, in the baby you put the blues next to each other and the reds next to each other okay.

535
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.210
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so let's take a look here.

536
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:56.340
Jessica Zaleski: What let's start trying to answer some of these questions Okay, so when you were picking because everybody, you know, there was some similarities, but.

537
00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:10.440
Jessica Zaleski: Every but you know, we had some different ideas on this, so how did you do it like what rules or criteria, did you use to decide how to make your baby, did you just like randomly pick.

538
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:19.620
Susan Snay: Like closing your eyes and just pointing to one of the one of the lines of the chromosomes or was there, something you were thinking about when you pick them.

539
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.130
Reggie: We should really write down the answers you want to tell you.

540
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.000
Jessica Zaleski: know just how.

541
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:36.870
Reggie: Okay, so I see no less time on like when we're looking at the chart like the boys had like one X and the y, which means it means when the most on longer and shorter, so I mean like my baby.

542
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:53.430
Reggie: I basically so I have one like i'm strengthen the mom they didn't you like, at least one or both, so I got one from the mom matched up with the same size from the dad even took the smaller ones and put it to the baby, so I know it's going to be a boy.

543
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.250
Susan Snay: Okay, by the picture of the cherokee mean that the carrier type that we looked at.

544
00:44:59.490 --> 00:44:59.970
yeah.

545
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:14.370
salam: Is I put like to from the moment to from the dead cover it all it depends on the gender so and I don't know like what's the gender, so I put two from the data from the mom.

546
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:16.950
Sarah Michaels: Why two not three.

547
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:22.680
salam: Because I don't think like it works like.

548
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.860
salam: I thought, like for works.

549
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:32.940
Susan Snay: wonderfully does could it have had anything to do with the size, the length of the chromosomes and the circle.

550
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:39.390
salam: yeah I put the medium ones for the mom and I put the small ones are did that, like.

551
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:46.020
Susan Snay: Oh yeah I was worried, I was wondering about that maybe because they didn't quite fit perfectly in the circle.

552
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.770
Jessica Zaleski: I think I just heard someone speak.

553
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.050
Nhi Nguyen (Student): yeah that was me.

554
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:59.880
Jessica Zaleski: Okay um can I see my screen and i'm gonna explain that I would love that Thank you go ahead.

555
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.840
Thanks me.

556
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.950
Reggie: he's got the bathroom.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.740
Sarah Michaels: A car is it making me that sharing.

558
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.580
it's me.

559
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.480
Okay.

560
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:38.670
Sarah Michaels: Good.

561
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.460
Nhi Nguyen (Student): um so like I did that because, like.

562
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:52.080
Nhi Nguyen (Student): This one is like that, and just want his mom because i'm.

563
00:46:53.160 --> 00:47:01.590
The this one's like X, Y and X so like I look at that label and I guess that.

564
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.880
Jessica Zaleski: Right, so you had.

565
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.670
Jessica Zaleski: To from each.

566
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:23.340
Susan Snay: So I heard her say, let me just make sure that I got this right so did you say need that you had you took an X, Y from one of the parents and an x X from the other parent.

567
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:24.600
yeah.

568
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:43.140
Jessica Zaleski: So um this, let me let's take a look at this for one second here, we talked about how this was a carrier type of a human right.

569
00:47:43.650 --> 00:48:04.620
Jessica Zaleski: A normal human normal human Okay, and how many pairs of chromosomes are in this carrier type look one of these is for female right this one and the other ones for a male how many pairs how many sets of two are there in each of these.

570
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.280
salam: And the last one is like yeah.

571
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.590
Jessica Zaleski: So 22 plus another pair is how many pairs.

572
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:23.100
Jessica Zaleski: Usually 23 okay so 23 pairs if you're a female human 23 pairs if you're a male human right.

573
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:34.200
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so do you think it matters, how many chromosomes an organism has let's take a look at that for a minute.

574
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.720
Jessica Zaleski: You think it matters, how many chromosomes and organism has.

575
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.690
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right so.

576
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.980
Susan Snay: But he's going to vote.

577
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.000
Jessica Zaleski: Either thumbs up with.

578
00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.470
Susan Snay: Some up, so we can see it.

579
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:56.550
Jessica Zaleski: cameras on thumbs up if you think it matters, how many chromosomes and organism has thumbs down if you think it doesn't matter how many chromosomes and organism has.

580
00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.410
Jessica Zaleski: So make sure we get cameras on, so we can see thumbs.

581
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:04.920
Jessica Zaleski: Right.

582
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:08.820
To.

583
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.720
Jessica Zaleski: i'm seeing.

584
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:13.290
Jessica Zaleski: A lot of.

585
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:16.530
Sarah Michaels: worry newly cameras on just stick your thumbs up.

586
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:19.140
Susan Snay: We can't see your thumb if your camera's not on.

587
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.120
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, there we go okay.

588
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.940
Jessica Zaleski: All right, excellent Okay, so what I don't know about you miss me but I saw a lot of thumbs up.

589
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.800
Susan Snay: I see a lot of thumbs up.

590
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.190
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so i'm gonna.

591
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.220
Jessica Zaleski: let's talk about this for a second.

592
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:52.350
Susan Snay: Right, so this is a chart that has the chromosome Count of all different organisms, so this is only a few organisms, but let's take a look at these will start at the top, because that's the first one that we looked at the carrier type of a human.

593
00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:02.820
Susan Snay: And it says on the right hand side that there's a total number of 46 chromosomes and how many pairs did we say any human.

594
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:12.390
Jessica Zaleski: 2323 alright so let's take a look at some of these other organisms in this chart well hold on a second I gotta ask you a question so.

595
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:22.440
Jessica Zaleski: you're saying 2046 and a human and but we said 23 How did we get from 46 to 23 somebody helped me out here.

596
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.010
Thanks.

597
00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:28.950
salam: I think, like you, don't count the pair's like pears you conflict by you, once.

598
00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:30.450
again.

599
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:38.760
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so you said 23 pairs and there's two and a pair so that means 46 total.

600
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.520
salam: I think you're gonna cannot.

601
00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.020
Susan Snay: Call singly one by one.

602
00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:43.860
yeah.

603
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:54.750
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, great so just so we understand so 46 individual chromosomes is the same as saying 23 pairs okay.

604
00:50:56.010 --> 00:51:00.450
Susan Snay: And how else can we do that, other than counting by one What could we do.

605
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:03.540
salam: Did I guess.

606
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:12.510
Jessica Zaleski: divide by 246 divided by two that's going to give me 23 all right it's gonna be a handy handy calculation to know.

607
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:28.500
Susan Snay: All right, so if we look at the next one it's a dog, a lot of you said you have dogs and a dog has 78 total chromosomes so how many pairs of chromosomes would a dog have.

608
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.410
that one might be a little bit harder.

609
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.730
Reggie: So much page that has yes.

610
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.720
Susan Snay: You can use your phone as a calculator if you need to.

611
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:40.890
46.

612
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:57.150
Jessica Zaleski: remember how we found for human we said 46 total chromosomes but 23 pairs Salam said divide by two so if it has 78 and we want to find out how many pairs.

613
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:06.540
Susan Snay: Leandro put it in the chat yep Leander why'd you put a question mark, are you just did you do it in your head.

614
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.050
Leandro Graterol: Like yeah i'm doing in my notebook right now Okay, so you did the long David okay.

615
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:21.930
Susan Snay: you're right, you are correct good job practicing your mouth all right, the goats really easy a goat has 60 total chromosomes how many pairs.

616
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.200
salam: of meeting one.

617
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.400
How about the mosquito.

618
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.250
Reggie: Do we know.

619
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:48.720
Susan Snay: Now we have some plants also rice, the rice plant, most of us have eaten rice, we sometimes some of us eat it almost every every meal right we're at least once a day total chromosomes in a rice cell is 24 how many pairs.

620
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:50.700
Reggie: whoa.

621
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:56.400
Susan Snay: Oh now look at this, what do you notice about a snail a rice and a snail so.

622
00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:04.470
Reggie: You both have the same amount of chromosomes, what do you guys think about that so so what, what do you think if we took a.

623
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:10.980
Susan Snay: sell out of a rice plant and looked at the camera type and then we took a fell, out of a snail.

624
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:15.180
and looked at the chromosome Kara type we'd see.

625
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.640
The same number of chromosomes.

626
00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.190
Do you think they're the same.

627
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.000
Jessica Zaleski: Do you think that the information on the chromosomes is the same.

628
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:28.980
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

629
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.240
Reggie: I think.

630
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:37.050
Reggie: They have the same amount that they both had the same amount of like chromosomes but like they might like be different shapes and sizes.

631
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:44.580
Sarah Michaels: shapes and sizes yeah we even really talked about the shapes and sizes alright so.

632
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.230
Susan Snay: Do you see anything that kind of stands out on this chart.

633
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.430
Jessica Zaleski: anything like surprising to you when you look at it and you're like wow.

634
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.150
Reggie: yeah basic.

635
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:55.860
numbers.

636
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:58.920
Susan Snay: Okay, they all have different numbers.

637
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.660
Reggie: The King crab has like.

638
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.680
Jessica Zaleski: 208 years.

639
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.740
salam: It has four pairs.

640
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:17.010
Susan Snay: yeah so use our carrier type of the King crab it would take up a lot more space on the page, then the human carrier type.

641
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:18.600
Maybe.

642
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:24.270
Because reggie said something that might make that difference.

643
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.790
Jessica Zaleski: That was ready right yeah that's it it's different sizes, it could be different sizes right.

644
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.670
Susan Snay: What else do you notice about all these numbers.

645
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.160
Edwin Bermejo: Cotton and pineapple had this him alone.

646
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.290
Jessica Zaleski: Oh cotton is 50 and pineapple is 50 huh.

647
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.430
Oh wonder if it has to do with being a plant.

648
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:52.170
Sarah Michaels: Well, it can't be just a plant because rice is 24.

649
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:54.690
Leandro Graterol: He can into dog.

650
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:59.340
Susan Snay: A chicken and a dog have the same number.

651
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.250
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah look at that dog is 78 chicken is 78 oh.

652
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:12.450
Jessica Zaleski: Now I see another one that's 78 though what's the other one that 78 I gotta move my cursor sorry.

653
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:13.770
Susan Snay: yeah dog.

654
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:19.320
Reggie: Is wheezing and it's I think it says a wolf but yeah okay as a Gray, Wolf.

655
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:21.510
Susan Snay: Oh yeah.

656
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.590
Susan Snay: So a dog and a Gray wolf have the same number of chromosomes.

657
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.020
Susan Snay: chicken, so does the chicken.

658
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:36.000
Sarah Michaels: yeah okay makes sense and dug in a Gray wolves they're sort of similar but then a chicken.

659
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:38.850
Sarah Michaels: anyway.

660
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:50.340
Jessica Zaleski: You know what I noticed about this was like well, let me ask you guys which of these organisms, do you think is closest to a human.

661
00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:11.070
Jessica Zaleski: I mean if you didn't see the chromosomes What would you think like just looking at the names of the organisms, I mean are we closer to a grain of rice or a king crab or a mouse or a chicken or a dog, what do you think.

662
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:12.060
Susan Snay: So you.

663
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.390
Jessica Zaleski: Know during the numbers if we don't look at the numbers at all.

664
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.580
salam: feel like the most.

665
00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:24.930
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, like if I said, what do you have more in common with a pineapple or a dog.

666
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:26.940
Jessica Zaleski: dog yeah.

667
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:31.350
Jessica Zaleski: I would think right, I mean I don't feel like I have a lot in common with a pineapple.

668
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:47.460
Jessica Zaleski: But look at the numbers, I mean a pineapple has 50 chromosomes we have 46 chromosomes and a dog has 78 yeah that is pretty close I mean cotton cotton oh yeah cotton is pretty close to the.

669
00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.690
Susan Snay: number that we have also.

670
00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.290
Susan Snay: gotten has 50 we have 46.

671
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.590
Sarah Michaels: To build on what Salam said.

672
00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:16.530
Sarah Michaels: she thinks that a mouse might be close to humans, I think they use mice a lot in studies, because the mouse body responds in similar ways, even though they're much smaller and it's kind of curious that humans have 46 and mouse has 42 sort of similar yeah.

673
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.050
salam: And it has 20 pairs.

674
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:22.320
Jessica Zaleski: yeah 20 pairs and we have 23 pairs.

675
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.760
salam: yeah and the pineapple has.

676
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.150
Jessica Zaleski: Okay don't.

677
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.490
Leandro Graterol: know the King crab have to.

678
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.870
Leandro Graterol: Like how.

679
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.810
Reggie: I said okay.

680
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.180
Jessica Zaleski: All right, so let me ask let's ask another question um.

681
00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:46.740
Jessica Zaleski: Do you notice any patterns, with the numbers.

682
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.860
Leandro Graterol: Wait what was the question.

683
00:57:50.430 --> 00:58:05.400
Jessica Zaleski: You notice any patterns, with the numbers of chromosomes what were we doing to find the number of pairs like these are the total numbers, but what what did we have to do mathematically to find the number of pairs.

684
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:06.570
Reggie: divide by to.

685
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.430
Jessica Zaleski: divide by two.

686
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.660
Susan Snay: So what pattern would that make in the total number of chromosomes.

687
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.100
Jessica Zaleski: What types of numbers, can you divide by two evenly.

688
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.820
Reggie: For even numbers.

689
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.230
salam: Like oh.

690
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.250
Jessica Zaleski: Even numbers are these all even numbers.

691
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.570
yeah.

692
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:32.160
Jessica Zaleski: What are the even numbers that were just looking at the ones place.

693
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.680
salam: Some of them are, but some of them.

694
00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.510
Some of them are not.

695
00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:44.040
Reggie: john 02630246 810 yeah.

696
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:54.030
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so 02466 a 064 so are these all even numbers.

697
00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:55.470
Reggie: yeah.

698
00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.030
Okay.

699
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.390
Jessica Zaleski: All right, I wonder, already.

700
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:06.660
Every single organism on the planet if we had a chart of all of them, I wonder if they would all have even numbers.

701
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:11.760
Jessica Zaleski: And why do you think they're always even numbers.

702
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.290
Reggie: Because it has been cooped up into pairs.

703
00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:18.090
Jessica Zaleski: What why.

704
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.620
Jessica Zaleski: Why do you think they have to be grouped up into.

705
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.310
pairs.

706
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.360
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, why pairs.

707
00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.250
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, why would they get that information is it in pairs.

708
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:46.380
Jessica Zaleski: I mean, think about what we were doing earlier what were what were we working on Where do they get that information yeah Where do they.

709
00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:54.510
salam: rid of the chromosomes come from it was gonna say like it gets copied does it have to Paris, but.

710
00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:58.710
Sarah Michaels: Also, maybe they get copied.

711
00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.680
Anisha Hassan: i'm Nero flipping interesting.

712
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.140
Anisha Hassan: Things make that.

713
01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.810
Jessica Zaleski: new things, make it.

714
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:07.380
Anisha Hassan: yeah.

715
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.410
Susan Snay: What do you mean by two things, two things.

716
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.110
Sarah Michaels: In you say a tiny bit more need.

717
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.450
salam: A baby.

718
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:24.390
Nhi Nguyen (Student): kitten data dad and mom so like if you need a dog like you have to like.

719
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:32.820
Nhi Nguyen (Student): Oh, like our girls say like like a data dog and like a mom dog to make a baby down.

720
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.510
Susan Snay: Like so on the male and a female okay yeah.

721
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:45.420
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so nice so do they get does that do the dad and the mom give the same amount to the baby.

722
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.000
Jessica Zaleski: What do you think.

723
01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:55.260
Jessica Zaleski: dad again you're the dad and the mom each give the same amount to the baby.

724
01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.470
Nhi Nguyen (Student): I don't know yeah maybe because um can you explain your question cuz I don't really get it.

725
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.820
Jessica Zaleski: So do so if the mom has.

726
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:21.390
Jessica Zaleski: um, for we talking about the feet, the human yeah sure we can talk about the human right, so the mom has 23 pairs or 46 chromosomes right.

727
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:36.300
Jessica Zaleski: let's do Paris and the dad has 23 are they each going to give the same amount to the baby or is one going to give more than the other yeah just seem like 23.

728
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.840
salam: I think, each of them is going to give like to.

729
01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:42.780
Jessica Zaleski: Well, let me ask you this.

730
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:51.390
Jessica Zaleski: alarm if each give two okay so here's an organism let's let's take a look at our dad and mom here how many pairs of chromosomes do we have in dad.

731
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:54.930
salam: Three like in just one minute yeah.

732
01:01:54.990 --> 01:02:01.230
Jessica Zaleski: And this one on my Can you see the circle Okay, so we got three pairs and dad and how many pairs we have in mom.

733
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.180
Jessica Zaleski: Good three.

734
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:12.840
Jessica Zaleski: Now, whatever organism, this is how many pairs does the baby have to have so that the baby is just like mom and dad.

735
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:19.440
Jessica Zaleski: Yet three pairs.

736
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.790
Reggie: Please do that again.

737
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.360
salam: Like each of them to then.

738
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:50.700
Susan Snay: We don't know what species, this is this could be a heel whether it's only get three pairs so it's obviously not a human, but we don't know what it is, but we do know that whatever species, it is the adult dad has three pairs of chromosomes and the adult mom has three pairs of chromosomes.

739
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.230
Reggie: me it's just a mosquito.

740
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.810
Sarah Michaels: Okay cool.

741
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:55.500
Jessica Zaleski: well.

742
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.820
Jessica Zaleski: As for right.

743
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.380
Reggie: Now go ahead sure I said they had six in each parish like yeah.

744
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.000
Jessica Zaleski: you're right.

745
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.860
Susan Snay: Good good observation.

746
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.420
Susan Snay: Right, maybe.

747
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:12.600
Jessica Zaleski: mosquito so let's This is great reading let's just talk about this is a mosquito dad and a mosquito mom.

748
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.490
Susan Snay: And now you need mosquito babies.

749
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.930
Jessica Zaleski: We need mosquito babies.

750
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:17.790
Jessica Zaleski: Oh.

751
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:23.940
Susan Snay: yeah go ahead, does the baby mosquito have to have in order to be a mosquito.

752
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:30.810
Reggie: 308 on day six but I guess be appears to be patient.

753
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.860
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

754
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:32.730
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): So one of the.

755
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.730
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): One of each size.

756
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:37.290
Susan Snay: Oh, that.

757
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:43.230
Jessica Zaleski: So let me, let me take this so you're saying, if I take a long one, a large one from dad.

758
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.190
Jessica Zaleski: Can I take another large one from dad.

759
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.920
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): know from like one from each.

760
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:58.740
Jessica Zaleski: Oh okay so i've got to take it from mom Okay, so it got whatever the long one is in a mosquito now there's one from dad and one for mom okay.

761
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.050
Jessica Zaleski: So, then, I go to the medium one.

762
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.340
Jessica Zaleski: Do I have to take a medium one from the mom Nora.

763
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.800
Jessica Zaleski: What do you guys think medium for mom.

764
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:15.630
Reggie: yeah.

765
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.820
Sarah Michaels: yeah OK.

766
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:23.280
Susan Snay: So now there's two pairs or four how many do we have to have to get a baby mosquito.

767
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.130
Reggie: tumor do you perish.

768
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.450
Susan Snay: But where we going to get them from.

769
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.280
salam: From the from the one.

770
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.270
Jessica Zaleski: Oh OK OK oh oh wait a minute hold on.

771
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.160
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): you're going to be a boy right.

772
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.200
Jessica Zaleski: well.

773
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:41.070
Susan Snay: I don't know yet.

774
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:48.960
Jessica Zaleski: i'm just gonna I was taking the first one so i'm just gonna take this one all right and i'm going to take this one.

775
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:55.890
Susan Snay: Right, so it looks like we have do we have the right amount of chromosomes to be a mosquito.

776
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.320
salam: yeah yeah.

777
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.240
Susan Snay: And do we have the right amount of pairs.

778
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:04.920
Reggie: Yes, okay.

779
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:12.900
Susan Snay: So when we remember back of the carrier type we looked at you all noticed that they were different size chromosomes.

780
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.010
Susan Snay: For male and female.

781
01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:24.930
Susan Snay: So do you remember, which which one male or female, had the two different sizes.

782
01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:29.640
Reggie: So male had two different sizes and the fever, at the same Okay, so does this.

783
01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:33.720
Susan Snay: Does this baby mosquito have to have the same size or two different.

784
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:41.370
Jessica Zaleski: Different okay see, this is a little bit confused, I think it got a little bit I think he got stretched a little so.

785
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:46.320
Susan Snay: it's not the little tiny one like dad has you see the little tiny one up and dad the yellow circle.

786
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:47.760
Jessica Zaleski: yeah there we go.

787
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.610
Jessica Zaleski: that's that's how it should be right, do you think that these mean it's a female or a male.

788
01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:54.810
Female.

789
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:57.570
Susan Snay: Oh.

790
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:59.520
Susan Snay: If that's the case then it's gonna.

791
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.080
salam: bite somebody.

792
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:14.970
Jessica Zaleski: that's been Now we just so okay so whoa alright, so we got a female here now, what if I had not taken this one from dad and I had taken this one from dad.

793
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.530
Jessica Zaleski: We would have been a male.

794
01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:17.820
Leandro Graterol: yeah man.

795
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:23.280
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right, what if I switched out the mom one and I took this one instead.

796
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.370
Reggie: is still in the mail, because it sounds like when shorter way.

797
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.250
Jessica Zaleski: yeah wait a minute wait a minute.

798
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:34.470
Susan Snay: Okay matter which which of those small which of the small chromosomes mom gives.

799
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.930
Because they're the same size.

800
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.640
Reggie: yeah I don't think it matters which region us.

801
01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:48.360
Jessica Zaleski: So mom can give this one or mom can give this one and it's still a male each time.

802
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:50.400
Reggie: yeah.

803
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.320
Jessica Zaleski: But if I switch these out with from dad this is.

804
01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:57.750
Reggie: The same size.

805
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.920
Jessica Zaleski: So that's a.

806
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.640
Jessica Zaleski: that's a female now it's a.

807
01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:04.680
Reggie: Male.

808
01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:15.150
Susan Snay: Oh, oh my so I, so I wonder what's happening, which is deciding which is the deciding.

809
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:18.660
Jessica Zaleski: parent.

810
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.120
Susan Snay: Parents a male or female.

811
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.470
Day.

812
01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:29.340
Jessica Zaleski: dad decides wow there are a lot of kings that actually be headed the Queen, I know I.

813
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.110
Susan Snay: know, and I think a history class.

814
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:44.190
Jessica Zaleski: So let's let's take a minute, I want to go back to our model for a minute, here we just add you guys just uncovered a lot of information, and I think we should probably add it into.

815
01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:54.120
Jessica Zaleski: Some of our rules okay so i'm actually going to just like start at the top, so what are some of the things we just learned going through this process.

816
01:07:55.830 --> 01:08:01.410
Reggie: Is the same size um they're female ones, like the other it's a meal.

817
01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.780
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so um.

818
01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.020
Susan Snay: If what the same size yeah.

819
01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.680
Reggie: The chromosomes.

820
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:20.460
Susan Snay: So is it any chromosomes any pair of chromosomes only a specific set of chromosomes.

821
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.890
Reggie: The last pair of chromosomes.

822
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:29.340
Susan Snay: Oh, so the last the last period that we looked at in the human stereotype okay.

823
01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:37.350
Jessica Zaleski: So one set of chromosomes determines if the offspring is male or female.

824
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.610
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe it's the last one, we saw was the last one and humans right and mosquitoes that just happened to be the last one.

825
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:46.410
Susan Snay: yeah we didn't see what type of others.

826
01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.670
Susan Snay: You know that there's one set that will determine that ELISE that's what you think yeah.

827
01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.690
Jessica Zaleski: And then anything else, we need to know about like.

828
01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:57.060
Jessica Zaleski: Related to that.

829
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.680
salam: it's like the mom and dad has three pairs today, we have two takers to.

830
01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:14.550
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, will be excellent observation offspring, will have the same number of chromosomes as the parent.

831
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:17.790
Susan Snay: Does anybody disagree with that.

832
01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.220
I see Christopher nodding saying no, I do not disagree.

833
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:31.110
Jessica Zaleski: offspring will have this I know this is really tiny, let me try to make this a little bit bigger here but that's Okay, because we're going.

834
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.920
Susan Snay: to actually be.

835
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.930
Jessica Zaleski: Oh that's not going to go through these.

836
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:34.950
These sentence.

837
01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:43.800
Susan Snay: we're going to probably try to put some together if they fit together and we might even get rid of some that we decided are not even true anymore.

838
01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:50.880
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely right in fact i'm thinking like we want to go through here and take a look at some of these.

839
01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:03.540
Jessica Zaleski: Anything you guys are reading on here that you're thinking and I don't know if I agree with that anymore.

840
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:27.930
Susan Snay: So make sure you read the question at the top, because that's what we're talking about, we want to know how does the heretical information get from the parent to the offspring.

841
01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.000
salam: To change.

842
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.260
Jessica Zaleski: Just take a minute and look at these and see if there's anything.

843
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.830
Jessica Zaleski: You don't agree with anymore.

844
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.590
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe we want to keep these for now.

845
01:10:53.790 --> 01:11:00.060
Susan Snay: it's okay to have a lot of rules, but if there's some that we don't agree with anymore it's okay to to cross them out also.

846
01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:10.140
Susan Snay: What do we think about number six.

847
01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:13.350
Jessica Zaleski: Number six here.

848
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.010
Susan Snay: passes through blood umbilical cord develops in the mother's womb.

849
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.820
Is that what do you guys think about that.

850
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:34.530
Jessica Zaleski: that's kind of a lot of ideas together like.

851
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:40.410
Jessica Zaleski: Is that how our genetic information gets passed.

852
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.970
Jessica Zaleski: From offspring to parent through their blood.

853
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.750
Susan Snay: Well, let me just ask this question, we just talked about a mosquito didn't we.

854
01:11:52.770 --> 01:12:01.410
Susan Snay: Read she said that that offspring, we were making might have been a baby mosquito do baby mosquitoes have umbilical cords.

855
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:03.960
Reggie: No, no.

856
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.310
Sarah Michaels: Oh about rice.

857
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:10.230
Susan Snay: rice I think we're thinking, the same thing does rice have an umbilical cord.

858
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.060
Jessica Zaleski: Does rice have blood.

859
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.050
No.

860
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:15.810
Reggie: Yes, true take that one off.

861
01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:26.010
Susan Snay: So these rules, this model that we're trying to develop, which is a set of rules should be rules that we can follow for any species.

862
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:29.340
Susan Snay: So that's what we have to think about okay.

863
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:32.700
Sarah Michaels: We should take six off.

864
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:33.480
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

865
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:36.180
Susan Snay: I heard reggie say that Jason said that all right.

866
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.070
Jessica Zaleski: Now i'm going crazy I just went to.

867
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.750
Jessica Zaleski: Live whoa.

868
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:54.240
Jessica Zaleski: This is when you overdo it Okay, let me, let me click happy now i've got so many little tabs open alright, so I think it's four or five right now why don't we take a five minute break OK.

869
01:12:54.690 --> 01:13:05.340
Jessica Zaleski: And i'm going to cross out number six and when we come back as soon as we come back in five minutes guys, we want you to have your notebooks and something to write with ready to go okay.

870
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:11.550
Susan Snay: So go take a stretch break go to the bathroom if you need to get a drink come back with your notebook.

Jessica Zaleski: I don't even know how to fix my screen here, this is.

874
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:26.400
Susan Snay: If you don't know how to do it, I don't think anybody.

875
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.220
Jessica Zaleski: Well okay now we're back to normal sorry.

Okay.

877
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.210

902
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:35.910
Jessica Zaleski: aim high and I can't wait I love podcast reggie I can't wait to listen to your science podcast.

903
01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:37.050
Reggie: That you miss.

904
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.830

01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:38.700
Susan Snay: Ignore your well.

921
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.140

Susan Snay: To see yeah yeah.

925
01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:00.120
Jessica Zaleski: And you can hide yourself from the view right, so you don't see yourself.

01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.890
I think.

927

943
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.800
Jessica Zaleski: sounds weird yeah.

946
01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:08.430
Anisha Hassan: yeah like everyone's cameras have to be on in our in my courses at least and it doesn't matter how a person is looking or what they're doing.

947
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.460
Susan Snay: or probably like yeah it's just what we do yeah.

948
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:22.800
Sarah Michaels: If you can show us, you know at least your eyes, that would be so nice because it just helps to feel like you know you there.

949
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.300
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so i'm going to share my screen again here.

Sarah Michaels: Jobs are great.

953
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:58.590
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we're looking at our rules right um yeah, I think, are we are we good with the rules for now, nobody said they wanted to take anything else away yep.

954
01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:01.980
Susan Snay: Okay, but we did add one a pretty good one, I think that.

955
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.770
Jessica Zaleski: yeah to that we're good yeah yeah.

956
01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:06.510
salam: The mission mission.

957
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:24.420
salam: If, like the dad or mom had to have like three pairs and they're going to give the baby like from each to like prepare I mean like three of the chromosomes a cow or they get a State prepares for them.

958
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:35.880
Susan Snay: Oh interesting so are you are you saying that if dad gives away one of each of his pairs and he won't have pairs anymore.

959
01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:46.860
salam: yeah I think so because, if he gives away the moment that does like one of each pair how about them, how is it getting step here's How does he stay.

960
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:48.870
Susan Snay: A dad because he gave away.

961
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:53.100
salam: So what I did I cook in piston because they like wanted to.

962
01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:55.590
Jessica Zaleski: See.

963
01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.110
Jessica Zaleski: replicated them.

964
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.950
Jessica Zaleski: And it's interesting.

965
01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.160
salam: is going to be confusing if they have like no parents.

966
01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.940
Sarah Michaels: yeah it looks weird yeah they look like they're not viable as humans.

967
01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:10.800
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely or musky viable.

968
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:11.280
You know.

969
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:19.320
Susan Snay: How like when we get new skin cells, how do you think we get chromosomes in our new skin cells, what has to happen to them.

970
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:23.490
Jessica Zaleski: Get copy day yeah.

971
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.060
Susan Snay: So you are actually ahead of it, you were thinking ahead.

972
01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:48.570
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so this is why you need your notebook because we're going to have you think about this question for a minute, why did mom and dad each have to have each kind of chromosome too long to medium too short, why to.

973
01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:57.030
Jessica Zaleski: Why are they in pairs go ahead and write your ideas in your notebook will give you 60 seconds to write your ideas down.

974
01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.040
Susan Snay: No right or wrong, why do you think that's it.

975
01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.010
Why are there pairs.

976
01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.530
Jessica Zaleski: What are your ideas anyone want to share.

977
01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:18.870
Reggie: I said almost got a point appears to they'll say like in the body like small spaces.

978
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:28.050
Reggie: Because, like the King crab has was called like 200 or something and it's it's not big it's pretty small to vote there in pairs so that they'll fit.

979
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.210
Oh that's interesting.

980
01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:39.570
Jessica Zaleski: So they're in pairs so so they get into into what.

981
01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.010
Susan Snay: Do you think that the King crab.

982
01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:45.240
salam: itself is small.

983
01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:48.150
salam: This.

984
01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.160
Reggie: I think i'm the King crab so.

985
01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.060
Reggie: Like chromosomes are small, but then you're supposed to perish that don't fit in.

986
01:26:55.620 --> 01:27:01.440
Susan Snay: OK, so the chromosomes themselves are small and they're in pairs so they fit in there, better.

987
01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:03.930
Reggie: yeah.

988
01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:05.970
Sarah Michaels: I.

989
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.060
salam: wrote like because, like.

990
01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:11.370

991
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:13.620
salam: it's a match.

992
01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:18.120
Jessica Zaleski: tell us more about that so i'm like What do you mean they match what.

993
01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.500
Jessica Zaleski: about them matches.

994
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.350
salam: yeah the size and color.

995
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.250
Jessica Zaleski: Equally yeah.

996
01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:34.740
Jessica Zaleski: Did anybody else have any other ideas about why.

997
01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:52.020
Jessica Zaleski: Why the mom and the dad will keep calling this a mosquito, I guess, because that was great like, why does the dad have too long to medium and to too short and the mom have too long to medium too short, why.

998
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:58.740
Sarah Michaels: He Sean road to parents mix and match their jeans.

999
01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.980
Sarah Michaels: You say a tiny bit more key Sean.

1000
01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:04.470
Sarah Michaels: say it.

1001
01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:25.950
Parents mix and match their genes mix and match.

1002
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:33.810
I wonder if you'd be easier to explain like maybe one of those pairs.

1003
01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.830
That we thought in terms of just one of the pairs.

1004
01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:54.870
Susan Snay: Does anybody think that they could explain why like dad has two long chromosomes.

1005
01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.260
Keyshawn: because those are their genes.

1006
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.670
Right.

1007
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:05.040
Susan Snay: Okay, so where did that get them from.

1008
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.190
Keyshawn: His parents.

1009
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.770
Jessica Zaleski: were losing the two long ones matchup key Sean.

1010
01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:18.960
Keyshawn: Yes.

1011
01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.540
Jessica Zaleski: And there are mics from his parents.

1012
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:24.660
Yes.

1013
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.520
Oh.

1014
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:36.360
Sarah Michaels: Good somebody that help us out here could somebody put that idea or think about what key Sean means and help us understand it.

1015
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:41.640
salam: This isn't like the number of conversations have to do like with the egg thing.

1016
01:29:47.250 --> 01:30:00.210
Sarah Michaels: What was stick with stick with this for a second so Can somebody think about put key sean's idea because i'm not sure I completely get it into their own words, explain what he was saying.

1017
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.480
salam: hey like get coffee.

1018
01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.850
Leandro Graterol: nice day for your own when they create i'll be there something.

1019
01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.820
Sarah Michaels: You say that one more time.

1020
01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:23.700
Jessica Zaleski: leandra can you just say that again.

1021
01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:35.760
Leandro Graterol: I think he where he say to parents missing much their hands right, so I think when they match I think he's saying.

1022
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.700
Leandro Graterol: When they create a baby or something.

1023
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.250
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so when they create the baby the pair's match up.

1024
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.810
Leandro Graterol: The jeans.

1025
01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.240
The jeans match.

1026
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.190
Okay.

1027
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:57.300
Sarah Michaels: You were saying.

1028
01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.650
salam: This I guess like.

1029
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.230

salam: Paris copy.

1031
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.450
chiefs calm like.

1032
01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:25.740
Jessica Zaleski: Well let's keep let's keep following this idea out a little bit because we, when we practice, making the baby in the purple circle.

1033
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:38.880
Jessica Zaleski: We everybody agreed that we're going to take a read long from the dad and a blue long from the mom and and this might be a really important time to say something like.

1034
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:56.700
Jessica Zaleski: we're using red and blue right to talk about the dad and the mom but let's take a look at this okay oh sorry i'm gonna i'm gonna let's take a look at this slide for a minute right here yeah.

1035
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:58.980
Susan Snay: Usually colors in these carrot.

1036
01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:00.210
Sarah Michaels: In these chromosomes.

1037
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:07.080
Susan Snay: That you see red and blue like we've been using.

1038
01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.280
Sarah Michaels: edwin's going right.

1039
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:25.410
Jessica Zaleski: yeah there's no red and blue chromosomes and here when when we're using the red and the blue wire, why are we coloring the chromosomes red and blue for this activity, what do you think why.

1040
01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.230
Reggie: Do you know the difference between the.

1041
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:29.970
Reggie: Two of them like the mom and dad.

1042
01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:37.620
Susan Snay: that's the only reason exactly so normally chromosomes will look very plain very Gray.

1043
01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:44.430
Susan Snay: And if we did that in the beginning, when you didn't know what they were you might not have a hard time deciding how to move them.

1044
01:32:45.240 --> 01:33:00.930
Susan Snay: So when we look at these chromosomes in these simulations that we're doing with the red and the blue don't think of them as red and blue just think of them, as some of them coming from a male and something some some of them coming from a female that might.

1045
01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:18.510
salam: that's why they have to.

1046
01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:39.780
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so they have tuned each pair so so when we're just saying too long to medium too short, but when scientists look at carrier types of chromosomes they actually number Okay, the chromosomes.

1047
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:57.270
Jessica Zaleski: To make it a little bit easier, so this is like pair one pair two pair three pair one for mom pair two pair three here's the babies pair one pair two pair three.

1048
01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:09.960
Jessica Zaleski: And if we look at the carrier tight, we can see that yeah these are these are different sizes, like, I can see 15 here is pretty small compared to like pair two.

1049
01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:20.550
Jessica Zaleski: But these pairs have all been arranged and numbered so I can see, we can see how many pairs Now let me ask.

1050
01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:26.910
Jessica Zaleski: What do you guys think is this a male human or a female human.

1051
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:28.470
salam: Nice, but I have a finishing.

1052
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:33.690
Jessica Zaleski: Second Salaam, this is a male human or a female human.

1053
01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:35.760
salam: Male.

1054
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.880
Jessica Zaleski: Anybody agree.

1055
01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.650
Reggie: yeah it's it's a male.

1056
01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:46.470
Leandro Graterol: Because I can't see your screen.

1057
01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:48.720
You can't see that.

1058
01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:51.720
Leandro Graterol: Right now.

1059
01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:56.490
Susan Snay: Okay, so key shawn says he thinks it's a male.

1060
01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:58.470
anyone else.

1061
01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:00.570
Leandro Graterol: was a question.

1062
01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:01.740
Reggie: it's a male.

1063
01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.810
Susan Snay: stereotype we're looking at right now, if there's a human male or human female.

1064
01:35:08.250 --> 01:35:08.700
Leandro Graterol: Male.

1065
01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.000
Sarah Michaels: Because how do you know.

1066
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.890
Sarah Michaels: I mean is this a guest or.

1067
01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.630
Sarah Michaels: Are you saying it has to be a male.

1068
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:23.250
salam: No, it has to be a male because, like the last two pairs of like one login one smaller ones making one small.

1069
01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:28.470
salam: that's why the, why is the smaller one in the big ones.

1070
01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:33.270
Susan Snay: And that makes it a male or female.

1071
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:38.220
salam: He shall do you agree with that.

1072
01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:45.150
Susan Snay: Okay yep because of the X, Y yep.

1073
01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:50.070
Susan Snay: So does anybody notice anything else about the the chromosomes.

1074
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:53.160
Reggie: did not like a straight line like someone's.

1075
01:35:54.450 --> 01:36:01.320
Susan Snay: going to ask yeah they you know when when you take these chromosomes out of a cell they don't straight now right, I mean.

1076
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.950
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

1077
01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:06.630
Susan Snay: Right, this is looking at them so that they can pair them up.

1078
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:21.960
Susan Snay: And match So if you could straighten them out you'd actually see that they were like that first stereotype we showed you this is a real carrier type, the first one that we showed you was just like a cartoon drawing and that's why they looked perfect.

1079
01:36:23.130 --> 01:36:23.550
All right.

1080
01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:26.760
Reggie: Now he may have.

1081
01:36:28.290 --> 01:36:30.420
Reggie: noticed is that if you look at them right.

1082
01:36:30.630 --> 01:36:39.870
Reggie: Oh sorry if you look at them i'm like she she got these white and black lines on them, you see that most of the way in black line sliding up to each other that's a you know that you see.

1083
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:42.930
Jessica Zaleski: I was gonna ask about.

1084
01:36:42.930 --> 01:37:03.750
Jessica Zaleski: That reggie Thank you so much, I was gonna say like how in the world do scientists know I mean again when it when they're looking inside the nucleus of a cell at the chromosomes they're not lined up all beautifully in pairs like this are they missed this nay.

1085
01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:08.550
Susan Snay: New a scientist actually has to arrange these like a puzzle.

1086
01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:10.830
Very.

1087
01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.030
salam: Nice ladies than the other.

1088
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:19.890
Susan Snay: What do you mean by can you give me an example of which ones you're looking at.

1089
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:25.950
salam: is like a little bit later than the others.

1090
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.490
Susan Snay: who thinks they have an idea of maybe what those colors mean what do the dark and the light.

1091
01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:38.310
colors mean what could they be.

1092
01:37:39.630 --> 01:37:42.810
salam: I guess it didn't get copied like right.

1093
01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:51.750
Sarah Michaels: there's there's this part of me that wants to go back and see that video that.

1094
01:37:51.870 --> 01:38:03.660
Jessica Zaleski: showed I know we could do that I just was looking like at number seven year I mean this one's on the leftist standing up a little straighter than the one on the right, but.

1095
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:13.050
Jessica Zaleski: Look at what reggie said here, I like you're what you're thinking here reggie you get the the darker at the top and it's little lighter.

1096
01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:25.740
Jessica Zaleski: me kind of see a couple darker bands right and then some lighter and then a real thicker dark band and then some lighter number 12 is pretty close those two chromosomes was.

1097
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.970
Sarah Michaels: A mirror image yeah right.

1098
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:38.100
Jessica Zaleski: And this is how scientists arrange them and put them together in their pairs.

1099
01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:40.320
Jessica Zaleski: wow.

1100
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.660
Jessica Zaleski: Because they're think that there's the same dark band.

1101
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:48.300
Susan Snay: On both of those number 12.

1102
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:55.440
Susan Snay: In the same spot or the same light bands, what do you think those could be.

1103
01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:02.220
Jessica Zaleski: I mean what's on these chromosomes what what what is on here.

1104
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.440
Susan Snay: You all have them.

1105
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:09.840
salam: T cells.

1106
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.630
salam: Gene.

1107
01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:14.910
Leandro Graterol: DNA.

1108
01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.520
Jessica Zaleski: Remember that the.

1109
01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:18.990
Jessica Zaleski: chromosomes are.

1110
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:21.570
Jessica Zaleski: We should go back and watch.

1111
01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:22.290
Susan Snay: It I think.

1112
01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:22.710
Susan Snay: Already.

1113
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:29.070
Jessica Zaleski: Really, let me, let me get the video because really yes okay.

1114
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:39.930
Susan Snay: very short now you're going to watch it again, and this is why sometimes it's important to go back and rewatch things because every time you watch it you learn you pick up something you didn't see before.

1115
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.140
salam: It might be the GS or the RNA.

1116
01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:49.620
Jessica Zaleski: So let's watch this and see if we can find the answer Okay, am I sharing my screen you.

1117
01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:51.390
Susan Snay: are sharing the pink cell yes.

1118
01:39:51.420 --> 01:40:06.780
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, but I want to stop for one second and then share again because I know I have to like optimize for there we go optimized for video clip here we go, I will learn zoom eventually and here where's the video club.

1119
01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.810
it's starting to come up it's taking a little love.

1120
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.860
Jessica Zaleski: I don't see it all right here we go okay there it goes yep alright.

1121
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:28.080
Edwin Bermejo: remembering those bands are.

1122
01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:42.630
Susan Snay: we're going into the cell traveling past all the organelles into the nucleus going through the nuclear poor and into a chromosome oh.

1123
01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:47.430
Jessica Zaleski: Did it stop I pause for a second.

1124
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:49.950
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so I positive.

1125
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:52.590
Reggie: St john's mega DNA.

1126
01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:55.110
Reggie: Things there.

1127
01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.030
Jessica Zaleski: Do you notice anything in this image here.

1128
01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:01.710
salam: yeah.

1129
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:04.140
Jessica Zaleski: What do you see, they.

1130
01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:05.280
salam: Are tears.

1131
01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:08.850
salam: Okay, and they're floating like everywhere.

1132
01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:10.020
Susan Snay: any others.

1133
01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.000
noora: X.

1134
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:13.740
Jessica Zaleski: yeah yeah.

1135
01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:18.060
Jessica Zaleski: Somebody said they're floating everywhere, like, I can see one up here.

1136
01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:19.620
Susan Snay: To the right.

1137
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:22.560
Sarah Michaels: So we know this is.

1138
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.280
Sarah Michaels: Because there's more than three pairs.

1139
01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:34.200
Jessica Zaleski: I see one here, I see one here, I see one here, I see one here, maybe down here yeah I can't be a mosquito you know.

1140
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:40.470
Jessica Zaleski: How many would how many pairs would we need for it to be a human.

1141
01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.360
Jessica Zaleski: Inside the nucleus, there would have to be.

1142
01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.870
Jessica Zaleski: 23 pairs for it inside the nucleus of every cell, for it to be a human okay so.

1143
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.320
Jessica Zaleski: let's take a look at what happens next.

1144
01:41:58.740 --> 01:41:59.880
Susan Snay: Now it's gone rabble.

1145
01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:01.590
Okay.

1146
01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.080
Susan Snay: Oh, I can start to see.

1147
01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:07.740
Susan Snay: The DNA on the right hand side stretching out.

1148
01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.070
Susan Snay: And something just got highlighted oh.

1149
01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:12.960
Reggie: James.

1150
01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:13.410
Can.

1151
01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:17.940
Leandro Graterol: see that right there yep back a little bit.

1152
01:42:18.930 --> 01:42:20.640
Susan Snay: you'll see that highlighted section.

1153
01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.170
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, I keep messing up well.

1154
01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:36.000
Susan Snay: I know it's like it's right at the end of the histone the good stuff So if you point, right after that it looks like a yellow circle, just after that, on the DNA to the right hand side you see how it's light right there.

1155
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.180
Susan Snay: all the way down to the bottom word star words like that what is that section called.

1156
01:42:45.450 --> 01:42:46.890
salam: What do you think those.

1157
01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:52.980
Susan Snay: dark and light bands, the the spots on the chromosomes are.

1158
01:42:56.730 --> 01:43:03.420
Jessica Zaleski: whoo now remember this is purple in the video, but our our chromosomes purple inside.

1159
01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:04.890
Leandro Graterol: ourselves no.

1160
01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.120
No.

1161
01:43:07.410 --> 01:43:15.990
Susan Snay: Now, remember the artists use these just so that it makes it look pretty and we can distinguish what is each part of the of the picture.

1162
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:18.780
mm hmm.

1163
01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:30.090
Sarah Michaels: I heard someone say Oh, like the light bulb moment but I wasn't sure who it was yeah well, I think it might have, I think I was thinking.

1164
01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:47.220
Sarah Michaels: When we looked at the picture before it was there was a light spot at the top, and then a darker spot, but this is on stranding tons so I guess I don't know what we're seeing in those light and dark spots on the chromosome.

1165
01:43:49.500 --> 01:44:06.240
Susan Snay: Well, if you go back go back to that that oh I don't think if you think about that stretched out DNA now it's going to be stretched out in the chromosome, how is it arranged if you if you follow that backwards and you had to put it back into the chromosome well would that light.

1166
01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:10.980
Susan Snay: stretched out DNA oh be stretched out anymore.

1167
01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:15.930
salam: But it was a patient miss I couldn't hear you so when that DNA.

1168
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:21.630
Susan Snay: In the video is stretched out and we have that that highlighted section that says, Jean.

1169
01:44:22.650 --> 01:44:29.580
Susan Snay: Right, if you have to put it back into a chromosome would still be long like that.

1170
01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:32.280
Leandro Graterol: What wouldn't have to what.

1171
01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:35.940
Susan Snay: How might, you have to put it back into that chromosome to make it all fit.

1172
01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.160
into to.

1173
01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:42.330
salam: Explain it I guess gets.

1174
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:46.950
Susan Snay: You had to squish it all back together.

1175
01:44:47.850 --> 01:44:49.200
Sarah Michaels: Would you would it yeah.

1176
01:44:51.630 --> 01:44:53.880
Susan Snay: Would it look Nice and long like that.

1177
01:44:56.910 --> 01:45:06.240
Susan Snay: So when you look at the chromosome bars those black and Gray and white sections that's because the DNA is folded all on top of each other.

1178
01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.760
salam: Does that make sense yeah.

1179
01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:24.540
Susan Snay: yeah So what do you think those Gray, like if we look at a dark Gray bar or black bar on that on an upset of chromosomes let's say number 12.

1180
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:27.450
Susan Snay: What is dark Gray.

1181
01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:29.400
Susan Snay: What do you think it is.

1182
01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:31.830
Key chain.

1183
01:45:33.150 --> 01:45:36.090
Susan Snay: So what do jeans, why do we have jeans.

1184
01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:47.160
Susan Snay: Do you think what are genes, for I think we talked a little bit about this in the beginning, right we talked about traits and we were asking you what traits do you have.

1185
01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:52.530
Susan Snay: that are similar to one of your sisters or brothers or a family member.

1186
01:45:56.670 --> 01:45:59.730
Susan Snay: What do you think john just said, maybe it's eye color.

1187
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:05.940
salam: jeans the jeans are like things that you share.

1188
01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:09.540
Oh, my gosh.

1189
01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:19.830
Jessica Zaleski: yeah this it's the screen is so sensitive on these slideshows awful.

1190
01:46:21.570 --> 01:46:28.470
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so where did where did each of these come from like if I asked you okay we've got this pair.

1191
01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:41.310
Jessica Zaleski: Where did this chromosome Oh, my goodness, I am going to have to do just label the number, if you say which chrome is like chromosome number one here number one chromosome number one where did the one on the Left from from.

1192
01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:50.190
Susan Snay: everybody's looking at the top left those two long chromosomes where did the one on the left, come from.

1193
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.840
salam: come from.

1194
01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.520
Reggie: I don't really get the question weekly.

1195
01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.390
Yes.

1196
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:07.620
Susan Snay: Okay, so the top left there's there's two chromosomes they're labeled number one right.

1197
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:16.560
Susan Snay: Where did the left of that pair the one on the left of the number ones where did that chromosome come from.

1198
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:20.220
salam: It was good to see you place, but it is.

1199
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:35.370
Jessica Zaleski: you're right, it is in the nucleus were so we're not asking where it's located about like where we know that the chromosomes have jeans on them right where did those where did that chromosome with those jeans where did that come from.

1200
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.090
Susan Snay: Maybe if I said, who did it come.

1201
01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:39.570
yeah.

1202
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.320
Susan Snay: Here we go.

1203
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:49.260
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so somebody said mom I mean we don't really know right if it's mom or dad but it's got to you one of them.

1204
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:50.190
Sarah Michaels: or dad yeah.

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.200
Sarah Michaels: kesha their mom or dad.

1206
01:47:52.260 --> 01:48:03.720
Jessica Zaleski: Okay perfect so it came from like we'll just say the one on the Left came from mom Okay, and the one on the right came from dad.

1207
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:13.410
Jessica Zaleski: right in the middle of it, it has that like dark band and somebody said, I think, was key Sean said, like maybe that's eye color.

1208
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:15.960
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so.

1209
01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:25.500
Jessica Zaleski: you're getting some information about eichler from mom and you're getting some information about eichler from dad.

1210
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:34.560
salam: But miss doesn't like shoulda coulda because they're not colored.

1211
01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.950
Susan Snay: Oh, so are you saying that like, if I have blue eyes, it should look blue on the chromosome.

1212
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.560
salam: yeah there's like that happens.

1213
01:48:47.610 --> 01:49:02.610
Jessica Zaleski: What is DNA, I mean we know that there's DNA inside those chromosomes but like what is the and if you had to explain to someone what DNA, is how would you explain it to like a younger brother or sister, these are what's DNA.

1214
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:09.090
salam: yeah, it is nice right.

1215
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.190
salam: it's what log.

1216
01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:18.480
Susan Snay: I want to make a cake.

1217
01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.480
Susan Snay: I opened up a recipe book.

1218
01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.200
Susan Snay: And i'm going to make i'm going to make a strawberry cake what color is a strawberry cake.

1219
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:30.270
Leandro Graterol: Red red.

1220
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:38.370
Susan Snay: it's reddish or pink right, but when I look at the recipe for it, what color are the words in the recipe book.

1221
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.300
salam: Oh, how can I read the.

1222
01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:46.500
Susan Snay: recipe black letters on a recipe book and get a red cake.

1223
01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.810
Reggie: Because strawberries are right.

1224
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:57.630
Susan Snay: So, could we think of the recipe.

1225
01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.440
Susan Snay: Like something we've been talking about here.

1226
01:50:02.850 --> 01:50:10.920
Leandro Graterol: The recipe is the instructions to make the cake yeah So what are we looking at here in this picture.

1227
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.040
What.

1228
01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.530
To.

1229
01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:19.290
Jessica Zaleski: To make what Leandro.

1230
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:21.360
Reggie: person.

1231
01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:22.170
yeah.

1232
01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.780
Susan Snay: Maybe even.

1233
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:27.090
Susan Snay: color.

1234
01:50:30.150 --> 01:50:50.220
Sarah Michaels: Little eyes or I pieces of eye color on the chromosomes but their instructions that are going to turn turn into I see so they wouldn't be blue if it's a blue eye color on that it would be instructions about how to make the eyes, including color yeah.

1235
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:58.800
Reggie: Wait so this Eric says everything have chromosomes are just some like some things okay do like this every like think of chromosomes.

1236
01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.180
Leandro Graterol: yeah the same question.

1237
01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:04.650
Susan Snay: What do you mean by everything can you think of something that you think might not have a chromosome.

1238
01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:09.030
Reggie: Oh, I see what I see you have a chromosome you know, do you mean.

1239
01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.380
Susan Snay: Like frosting for cake.

1240
01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:12.930
Susan Snay: I said yeah Oh, is that alive.

1241
01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:14.970
Reggie: No.

1242
01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:16.530
Okay.

1243
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.110
Can anybody think of something else that they they're not sure if there be chromosomes in it.

1244
01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:24.330
Sarah Michaels: What.

1245
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:26.040
salam: I have a question what.

1246
01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:28.830
salam: works.

1247
01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.010
salam: I don't know.

1248
01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.640
Reggie: Okay, does it have to be living to have chromosomes.

1249
01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.300
Jessica Zaleski: Do you guys think yeah.

1250
01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:39.630
Like.

1251
01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:44.460
Leandro Graterol: Something that is alive.

1252
01:51:45.450 --> 01:51:50.310
Susan Snay: Well, how did How did this person get these chromosomes did did.

1253
01:51:52.710 --> 01:51:57.150
Jessica Zaleski: I want to say, let me, let me ask another question where our chromosomes again.

1254
01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.100
salam: And then we'll play.

1255
01:51:59.490 --> 01:52:00.840
Jessica Zaleski: And where's the nucleus.

1256
01:52:01.410 --> 01:52:02.280
Reggie: In our body.

1257
01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:03.090
salam: body.

1258
01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:07.920
Jessica Zaleski: Oh so i'm just like have a bunch of nuclei floating around in my body.

1259
01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:15.390
salam: know one big circle and there's a circle and there's the DNS name there and then the cold.

1260
01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:17.850
salam: Outside so called.

1261
01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:20.760
Susan Snay: that's holding all these things together.

1262
01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.470
Reggie: So um do you.

1263
01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:27.330
Reggie: Have master excel know.

1264
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:28.410
Reggie: is someone British.

1265
01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:32.400
Susan Snay: So you're thinking about what it's actually called you don't have to worry about that.

1266
01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:35.190
Susan Snay: What is the whole thing called.

1267
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:38.520
Susan Snay: ourselves alive.

1268
01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.490
Reggie: Yes, yeah yeah me would would icing have chromosomes.

1269
01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:48.270
Jessica Zaleski: No cell phone have chromosomes.

1270
01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:49.050
salam: You know.

1271
01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:53.070
Jessica Zaleski: cuz we call it a cell phone but there's.

1272
01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:55.440
Jessica Zaleski: A cell phone APP cells in it.

1273
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.390
Jessica Zaleski: I never.

1274
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:03.720
Sarah Michaels: was a cell phone have cells in it.

1275
01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:06.990
salam: No, that was dumb question for me.

1276
01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:08.010
Sarah Michaels: was not.

1277
01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.120
Jessica Zaleski: wasn't at all.

1278
01:53:10.170 --> 01:53:10.680
Susan Snay: No.

1279
01:53:11.010 --> 01:53:17.010
Sarah Michaels: Because you know does a cell phone have instructions in it, I mean.

1280
01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.480
salam: yeah yeah.

1281
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.020
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1282
01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:24.150
Susan Snay: cell phone copy itself.

1283
01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:25.680
Leandro Graterol: No way.

1284
01:53:25.890 --> 01:53:29.400
Susan Snay: Fish because if mine broke like it could just poof make another one right.

1285
01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:30.990
Like.

1286
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.880
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

1287
01:53:34.710 --> 01:53:41.190
Susan Snay: If I if I take two cell phones my husband cell phone in my cell phone and I put them together will they be able to make another cell phone.

1288
01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:48.000
Jessica Zaleski: That would be a nice way to replace your phone if it broke right you did.

1289
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.380
Reggie: Okay, Miss i'm in debt.

1290
01:53:51.780 --> 01:54:02.370
Susan Snay: But it does have the same word in it, so that makes sense that you would ask that it's spelled the same way right so that's that's a totally understandable question absolutely is.

1291
01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.490
Anisha Hassan: The chart also had caught in and rice so.

1292
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.890
Susan Snay: Cotton and rice, are they so is cotton alive.

1293
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.110
salam: it's made up of.

1294
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:15.750
Jessica Zaleski: Our plants alive.

1295
01:54:16.770 --> 01:54:17.340
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

1296
01:54:17.490 --> 01:54:19.290
Jessica Zaleski: yeah hey there you go.

1297
01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:21.210
Susan Snay: So I think you found your answer.

1298
01:54:22.050 --> 01:54:24.060
Reggie: So, has to be living to have.

1299
01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.200
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

1300
01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:27.480
Jessica Zaleski: There you go to be living.

1301
01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:28.140
You guys.

1302
01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:32.340
salam: And something has to make it look somebody's.

1303
01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.020
Leandro Graterol: face all of these questions, I will ask to my to my closet I.

1304
01:54:39.450 --> 01:54:40.110
Leandro Graterol: see what he's got.

1305
01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:46.170
Susan Snay: to learn new things that you can actually talk to other people about absolutely.

1306
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:54.960
Sarah Michaels: Wait salon said something really interesting so she said, it has to be alive, and it has to have been made by.

1307
01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:56.820
Sarah Michaels: What did he say.

1308
01:54:57.210 --> 01:55:02.760
salam: something it has to be like made by something a person or like a plant or something alive.

1309
01:55:03.090 --> 01:55:05.700
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, come from something.

1310
01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:06.450
alive.

1311
01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:13.260
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right so.

1312
01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.490
Susan Snay: they're making some great.

1313
01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:34.110
Jessica Zaleski: really are OK, so now are the chromosomes in the pairs that you see below like dad's pair that have ones mom's pair of ones are those exactly the same, do you think.

1314
01:55:35.550 --> 01:55:38.100
Jessica Zaleski: Why, or what like is the DNA.

1315
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:52.980
Jessica Zaleski: going to try to do this without my screen going crazy turn my pointer on is the DNA in this chromosome exactly the same as the DNA in this chromosome.

1316
01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:55.770
Jessica Zaleski: In his DNA.

1317
01:55:56.130 --> 01:56:03.330
Jessica Zaleski: In this chromosome exactly the same as the DNA in this chromosome.

1318
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:14.640
Jessica Zaleski: Take a moment and think about it and write it down in your notebook, can I just ask, I just want to make sure that we understand the question I was saying, is the DNA in.

1319
01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:17.310
Susan Snay: Each number one chromosome exactly the same.

1320
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:25.950
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly so is this is this genetically exactly identical in its DNA with this one.

1321
01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.320
Susan Snay: Because the point is a little bit blurry when you're moving it.

1322
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:38.550
Jessica Zaleski: Oh sorry is this one i'm going to move it down here is this number two exactly the same exact same DNA, as this number two.

1323
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:48.450
Jessica Zaleski: Is this number three exactly the same as this number three take a minute and think about it.

1324
01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:57.780
Leandro Graterol: So yeah I good question is, and you could think of the same thing for.

1325
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:12.180
Susan Snay: The mom is the moms number one identical to the moms other number one is the moms number two identical to her other number two is the information on those two chromosomes the same exactly the same.

1326
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:38.550
Jessica Zaleski: Now here's a little hint think now again remember that in real life, our chromosomes are not red and blue okay so think about where each member of a pair came from think about in dad where did this number one come from and where did this number one come from.

1327
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:45.840
Jessica Zaleski: Where did this number to come from and where did this number to come from.

1328
01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:53.460
Susan Snay: The key Sean said he thinks that yes, they are the same, but one comes from mom and one comes from dad.

1329
01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:56.940
salam: I think the biggest thing.

1330
01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:03.030
Sarah Michaels: Could I ask a question of key Sean or anyone.

1331
01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:06.630
Sarah Michaels: Are they exactly the same.

1332
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:09.690
Sarah Michaels: In terms of.

1333
01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:23.370
Sarah Michaels: let's say I color is on one of them, and if one came from the mom and she had blue eyes and one came from the dad and he had brought another words are do they are they exactly the same.

1334
01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.860
Reggie: No, no, not exactly.

1335
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.580
But.

1336
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:30.240
salam: If they have a question.

1337
01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:35.760
salam: Some people get born like with different eyes color one light blue one green.

1338
01:58:36.210 --> 01:58:40.110
Sarah Michaels: that's very rare but it happens happen yeah but.

1339
01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.500
salam: Like does it like is it different.

1340
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:45.960
salam: It was like.

1341
01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:51.930
salam: like an eye color one right one blue one green like.

1342
01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:54.930
Sarah Michaels: The dad gave the green and the mom the blue.

1343
01:58:55.230 --> 01:58:57.300
Sarah Michaels: But that doesn't typically happen.

1344
01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.300
Jessica Zaleski: doesn't work exactly like that.

1345
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:02.040
Susan Snay: yeah I don't want to give away that answer.

1346
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.520
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

1347
01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:05.280
Susan Snay: I mean, I could explain it really easily but I don't want to.

1348
01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:26.730
Jessica Zaleski: So so let's let's take a look at the baby for a second okay does anybody think that let's look at pair number two here for a minute does anybody think that the DNA in this chromosome is exactly the same as the DNA in this chromosome.

1349
01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:28.350
salam: No.

1350
01:59:28.890 --> 01:59:29.790
Jessica Zaleski: Why not.

1351
01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:36.630
salam: Because it can, can you like from a different gender have different choices.

1352
01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:39.150
Jessica Zaleski: So wait a minute where did this one come from.

1353
01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.030
salam: To.

1354
01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:43.260
salam: From the time.

1355
01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:46.440
Jessica Zaleski: This came from the dad and where did this one come from.

1356
01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:47.160
mom.

1357
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:56.220
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so the blue chromosome number two came from the mom and the red chromosome number two.

1358
01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:58.920
Susan Snay: came from the dad that what you're saying.

1359
01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.710
Sarah Michaels: Where did the moms number two's come from.

1360
02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:02.730
Jessica Zaleski: yeah where did this.

1361
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:03.930
Jessica Zaleski: One come from.

1362
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:09.240
salam: good guys take a.

1363
02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.490
salam: Look it's blue miss.

1364
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:24.120
Jessica Zaleski: Okay Well, this is where we have to stop thinking about the blue and the red right here, yes, we are using blue and red to represent what really what color are these chromosomes.

1365
02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.700
Susan Snay: Like why I can white.

1366
02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.450
Jessica Zaleski: black and white.

1367
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:33.480
Susan Snay: So you have to ignore the fact that their colors and think about where the chromosomes came from.

1368
02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:34.920
Reggie: where they came from their.

1369
02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:40.890
Reggie: Parents so for our like doing that we made, we took them from the mom mom and dad.

1370
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:53.070
Reggie: And the is obviously going to be a boy, because one of them is longer than the other, so when i'm thinking is that one month the parents are making the mom maybe they had to they are the same exact size and that's how I became a girl.

1371
02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:02.790
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so if you get the same exact size you're a girl, and if you get the different size for three you're a boy.

1372
02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:04.800
salam: Yes, yes.

1373
02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:05.850
Okay.

Sarah Michaels: Could I.

1375
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:21.120
Sarah Michaels: pick question some of you are talking a lot, and some of you aren't talking as much, but it is everybody okay with this is everybody following what the conversation is just thumbs up if you're understanding or thumbs down if you're not.

1376
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:28.050
Susan Snay: that's the point yeah important to participate.

1377
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:35.400
Sarah Michaels: And you'll need to do, can you speak a thumbs up or thumbs down, are you are you with the rest of.

Good good.

1393
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:24.510
Jessica Zaleski: All right, so.

1394
02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:37.020
Jessica Zaleski: What is the consensus here, what do we think do we I think we've all kind of come to an agreement right that the information on this chromosome.

1395
02:02:38.670 --> 02:02:41.550
Jessica Zaleski: is not exactly I know I turned my.

1396
02:02:42.810 --> 02:02:44.220
Susan Snay: knees better without that read.

1397
02:02:44.250 --> 02:02:45.510
Jessica Zaleski: Because it doesn't is it.

1398
02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:53.130
Jessica Zaleski: wow okay sorry sorry sorry I will you use the pointer oh okay use the cursor.

1399
02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.210
Susan Snay: it's not delayed.

1400
02:02:54.300 --> 02:03:06.420
Jessica Zaleski: us the so okay so so the information on this chromosome is not exactly the same as this, because this one's from dad right and this one's from who.

1401
02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:21.240
Jessica Zaleski: Was the other way around it doesn't matter because mom mom okay yeah but I knew in this example so so The same is true up here right, this is not exactly the same as this, because one of these is from.

1402
02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:22.530
Jessica Zaleski: Who.

1403
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:29.730
Jessica Zaleski: One is from dad and one is from mom okay.

1404
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:30.330
Susan Snay: And i'm.

1405
02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:31.620
Jessica Zaleski: You guys, but like.

1406
02:03:32.610 --> 02:03:45.900
Jessica Zaleski: In my family my dad and my mom are not exactly the same with their DNA, I mean that's impossible, they were exactly the same one could not be male and one could be not be female right.

1407
02:03:50.130 --> 02:03:54.390
Jessica Zaleski: Because we know that these are not exactly the same.

1408
02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:03.660
Susan Snay: that's what determines the male in this case and the two number three is that are the same determines what was the female in this case.

1409
02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:14.520
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so you know I know we have about three minutes left but Oh, we got to talk about the kit and our last three minutes.

1410
02:04:15.090 --> 02:04:26.970
Jessica Zaleski: This is a perfect place we've got to pretty much exactly where we wanted to stop today, but I want to show them Oh, can you talk quickly about what why we're asking them this question miss miss OK.

1411
02:04:27.150 --> 02:04:36.180
Susan Snay: So the kids that we tried to order on back order for the DNA extraction and we really want you to experience extracting DNA at home.

1412
02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:44.970
Susan Snay: So we're asking you to go on a scavenger hunt of your House to see if you have some of the supplies at home.

1413
02:04:45.330 --> 02:05:03.510
Susan Snay: Because i'm willing to go and pick up any extra things that we need, but if you have this at home already it will make it a lot easier so we're going to ask you to look for these things at home okay really simple things that most of you probably have at home already I mean.

1414
02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:16.740
Jessica Zaleski: These things until next weekend we're going to try to do this lab activity next weekend, but you will need these supplies to do it, so the first one is some salt yep.

Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right i'll see you later.

1463
02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.150
Susan Snay: bye bye I hope everything's okay thanks.

1464
02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:13.200
Sarah Michaels: yeah me too.

1465
02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:15.300
Sarah Michaels: Alright guys.

1466
02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:16.710
Sarah Michaels: anything.

1467
02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:19.050
Susan Snay: That was pretty cool.

1468
02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:36.690
Anisha Hassan: Really cool when Salaam was like oh I don't want them to like the parents to still have, and she copy pasted the DNA, instead of being like oh when they like not let go of the DNA or would they have less.

1469
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:39.270
Susan Snay: Right, so if they gave it away, they wouldn't have enough.

1470
02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:41.160
Anisha Hassan: That was and so she.

1471
02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:46.350
Susan Snay: without even knowing it, she has figuring it out that was great yeah.

1472
02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:55.020
Sarah Michaels: I mean we're still having trouble with you, with Uli.

1473
02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:04.560
Sarah Michaels: don't know you know, maybe we just won't give her the stipend or we won't give her the full stipend or something I don't know, maybe not we'll see we'll have to.

1474
02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.050
Anisha Hassan: i'm reaching a hard time because.

1475
02:10:07.110 --> 02:10:13.470
Susan Snay: I was looking at JESSICA screen, because it was presenting and all I could see was the strip of people above it.

1476
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:14.430
Sarah Michaels: Oh.

1477
02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:20.970
Susan Snay: I had to scan through like hit the arrow so that I could see who didn't have their camera on because they always last.

1478
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:26.670
Sarah Michaels: So there's the way there's a way to adjust that I think if you put on gallery view.

1479
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:34.500
Anisha Hassan: Even when i'm presenting and no so I was presenting you see their screen.

1480
02:10:34.650 --> 02:10:57.300
Sarah Michaels: yeah so when when someone's presenting I can slide the presentation there's a bar between the people this isn't when it's on top it's when it's on the side and other words if it's if I slide the presentation, make it a little bit smaller than all of a sudden, I can see all the faces.

1481
02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:00.330
Sarah Michaels: This is a gallery view or.

1482
02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:01.440
i'm.

1483
02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.090
Anisha Hassan: Already.

1484
02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.300
Susan Snay: I have his gallery view and.

1485
02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:14.130
Sarah Michaels: speaker view yeah yeah and she can't you can't do that with them, what if you put on gallery view.

1486
02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:17.400
Susan Snay: On gallery view I see.

1487
02:11:19.230 --> 02:11:21.810
Susan Snay: In this usually i'll just see all the people.

1488
02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:24.630
Sarah Michaels: But the presentation is.

1489
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:26.250
Susan Snay: The majority of the space.

1490
02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:29.520
Sarah Michaels: But you can slide that that's the thing I want you to try that.

1491
02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:30.570
Susan Snay: yeah i'm gonna have to try that.

1492
02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.670
Raquel Fernandes: On your screen, while someone shares know yeah that doesn't work.

1493
02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.180
Anisha Hassan: OK, I can share my screen and then you can try to.

1494
02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.300
Anisha Hassan: Like figure out what's happening.

1495
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:45.960
Susan Snay: Okay i'm just trying to see if I can call people out, if I can tell that they're not on.

1496
02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:47.550
Sarah Michaels: yeah exactly so so nice.

1497
02:11:48.780 --> 02:12:08.400
Sarah Michaels: To just in terms of view put it in side by side gallery view and then you see there's a little bar if you if you mouse over between the people and the presentation, you can slide it and then it gets bigger or smaller, can you do that.

Susan Snay: At the top or it says view all I see is you are viewing initial screen and then next to it has a little black box, with a drop down arrow and so it's options, the only thing I have choices, there are original size and enter full screen.

1515
02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.790
