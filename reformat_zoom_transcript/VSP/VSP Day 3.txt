3
00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:05.640
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah and well what was funny was that I did the curbside pickup and they just put it in the back, and then, when I went to open my trunk it fell out and it decapitated itself because it's art, so I had this I will ED rolling around in the parking lot at target where.

4
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.620

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.810
Jessica Zaleski: So good so good yeah.

16
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:17.940
Jessica Zaleski: So everything should be linked in that vsp planner document I went through and link to everything on oh also so you saw yeah I set up a Google classroom I.

17
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.860
Susan Snay: thought that I thought I was going crazy i'm like.

18
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.890
Jessica Zaleski: I was like when I was like how are we going to.

19
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:37.140
Jessica Zaleski: get this i'm like oh my gosh would be so much easier if I just made a Google classroom and then like they attach the picture to that, and then I go in and get it like so for pushing some of this stuff out it's just easier for them to have it to get it that way.

20
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.840
Anisha Hassan: Can you report on Google classroom.

21
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.040
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, not Google meat, which is the video feature i'm talking about like the student management system that.

22
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.870
Anisha Hassan: No yeah no.

23
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.870
Anisha Hassan: I never use that so I have no idea how that works yeah.

24
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.860
Jessica Zaleski: No it's just I mean I can show you what it looks like in fact i'll show you.

25
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.460
Jessica Zaleski: Referring to them, trying to send us work.

26
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:09.000
Jessica Zaleski: Right exactly exactly so like work, this is what their Google classroom looks like now, so I just set this up and then.

27
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:19.620
Jessica Zaleski: they'll have i'll do, one for each session and i'll go in and Edit this and push it out and then they'll be able to just go in and access the survey about how they felt, you know in class.

28
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:31.200
Jessica Zaleski: When they like this assignment when we want the picture of the final model phil just go in and they can take a picture, however, they want and attach it here, and then I can go in and easily grab them.

29
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:44.970
Jessica Zaleski: So it's just a little bit easier for like work distribution now Google, which we use at school that's all integrated in here that's how they access like lot you know virtual class but.

30
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.130
Jessica Zaleski: We wouldn't use that.

31

40
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:56.790

41
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:06.120
Jessica Zaleski: After that yeah i'm going to get up, I mean, I know I got nothing going on, so how did you train and go oh it's actually like decent yeah yeah.

42
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.320
Susan Snay: You got a good team.

43
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:16.050
Jessica Zaleski: It has gotten so much money for technology Sarah said she spent $6.5 million on technology this year.

44
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:26.790
Jessica Zaleski: From the cares act and from grants they got three new grants one to pay for Internet through horizon.

45
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.120
Jessica Zaleski: For middle school I don't know there were two one to pay for spectrum for families that can't afford it.

46
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.410
Jessica Zaleski: So the Western public schools gets the grant and then they're paying the families and there's like a vetting process for that, but it's going to pay for like 150 families that need Internet.

47
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:54.300
Jessica Zaleski: Then there's something she some horizon something to give hotspots to like every middle and high school family or something they're going to be like.

48
00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:04.710
Jessica Zaleski: hiring trainers, to help oversee this program next year, like this, my massive grant and collaboration with verizon it was like amazing so.

49
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.400
Susan Snay: Get rid of that that excuse right that the kid has the all the time hotspots not working, whatever.

50
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:20.340
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and if more money comes through from that you know coven money, one of the top things is upgrading the teacher devices.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.360
Jessica Zaleski: Each doing their own individual data okay.

294
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.320
Susan Snay: come to a consensus of what you know, the combination of these drawings today so.

295
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:29.850
Jessica Zaleski: I think I got one from Christopher did you get one from angie and Nora let me see i've got one yep I got one from angie angie and nor is a.

296
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.960
Susan Snay: Very close.

297
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.690
Jessica Zaleski: Okay that's fine I can put them all in it's no problem.

298
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.480
Jessica Zaleski: A final just.

299
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.010
Jessica Zaleski: know no problem at all, yes, go ahead Edwin.

300
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:42.930
Edwin Bermejo: Thank goodness.

301
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.870
Jessica Zaleski: wow I can't wait for you guys to see these.

302
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.010
Jessica Zaleski: This is exciting.

303
00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.710
Susan Snay: I can't wait to see the other group so.

304
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.400
Jessica Zaleski: I know.

305
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:10.650
Jessica Zaleski: All of your minds are working now Okay, and you said angie and Nora so so Edwin didn't upload a picture Edwin has some information to share for perfect okay.

306
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.760
So, yes.

307
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:20.490
Anisha Hassan: i'm honestly we couldn't see nora's drawing properly because of the light, but this is amazing.

308
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:22.950
Anisha Hassan: Okay.

309
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.100
Sarah Michaels: So then Jay are you guys can.

310
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.410
Anisha Hassan: You can alert search are two.

311
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.830
Jessica Zaleski: g's an initial in the jam board right now looking.

312
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:33.480
Susan Snay: yeah.

313
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.010
Jessica Zaleski: we'll keep the rest of you in.

314
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:35.730
suspense.

315
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.400
Anisha Hassan: Sorry, but it's just my group i'm so proud of them they're so.

316
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:49.200
Susan Snay: determined to get a really you know artistic piece of work done.

317
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.200
Jessica Zaleski: All right, we're getting there.

318
00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:07.230
Sarah Michaels: I think in our group because Elio was such an amazing drawer we let him do it, and so we don't have one from everyone, I will.

319
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:13.500
Jessica Zaleski: know that that's Okay, I mean we are my group only had one okay oh yeah no it's not.

320
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.370
Susan Snay: Think, I mean if we were in the classroom we'd have our big whiteboards.

321
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.570
Susan Snay: The large size that.

322
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:19.140
Jessica Zaleski: Everybody yeah.

323
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:25.860
Susan Snay: doodle on and then decide on one drawing that represented everybody a little bit harder virtually to do that.

324
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:26.820
It is.

325
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.090
I can't wait.

326
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:47.160
Susan Snay: And if we knew that everybody had like a draw on computer screen, then we could all do it collaboratively but it's a little bit harder when when not everybody has that.

327
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:47.850
yeah.

328
00:41:51.030 --> 00:42:00.150
Jessica Zaleski: we'll just make what we have work perfect okay so from group three we're just looking for one from i'm just looking for one from kaplan.

329
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:07.710
Ms. B: um it should just be one that came up from Salaam we just model just one.

330
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.280
Okay.

331
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.100
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right, I got it.

332
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.590
So, Christopher newly did you get a chance to go over to Google classroom the virtual.

333
00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.090
Science pod classroom and just to answer that participation.

334
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.240
Question just one question.

335
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.480
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

336
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:24.720
My groups here, I think, oh now it's just Julie, so if you just answer that real quick usually it's just one really short question.

337
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.640
Jessica Zaleski: No right or wrong just yeah.

338
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.100
This is asking how you feel about something with it.

339
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.440
Some reason it's not letting me actually open up the excel to check that.

340
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.710
surveys that can do it another way.

341
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:27.270
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so you said you you're having trouble opening not letting the open the survey, to see the excel spreadsheet that.

342
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:45.180
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, let me it's only letting me actually try to answer this from a student hmm odd but okay that's Okay, I was just checking to see if that they were actually done so we're just looking for that looks like we've got 13 responses so yeah just one student hasn't.

343
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.060
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

344
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.630
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so here's the.

345
00:44:53.730 --> 00:45:14.490
Jessica Zaleski: So, again, I told at least I told the students in my group i'm that there were no names on this so i'm looking at a spreadsheet with the student responses, but I don't have any idea who did what there's no email addresses there's no names there's nothing so um and.

346
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:21.900
Jessica Zaleski: Go ahead sorry completely anonymous completely anonymous okay so.

347
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.010
Jessica Zaleski: I think what we'll do is i'm even going to like.

348
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:36.360
Jessica Zaleski: just going to even hide that so maybe we can take a look at these but absolutely no one can tell who wrote one.

349
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.880
Susan Snay: of answers that are very similar including if teachers answer this.

350
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:43.710
Jessica Zaleski: As oh yeah.

351
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:55.260
Jessica Zaleski: yeah but before we even like before we even get to that um you know we just want to talk about why we asked.

352
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:03.180
Jessica Zaleski: Sorry i'm ripping my earbuds out of mine i'd here um why we even asked you that question.

353
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.110
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so the question was.

354
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:30.390
Susan Snay: I can see it right here yeah the question in the survey was think of a time when you shared answer or idea in class and the teacher questioned or challenged your answer, how did that make you feel were you more or less likely to participate after that.

355
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:40.140
Jessica Zaleski: So, so that was what we were really wondering, because one of the things that we're we're going to be doing in the virtual science pod a lot.

356
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:52.440
Jessica Zaleski: Is we're going to be respectfully questioning each other and kind of pushing each other along challenging each other, respectfully.

357
00:46:52.830 --> 00:47:02.100
Jessica Zaleski: And we know that you may have experienced that before in other classes and maybe it was a negative experience Maybe it was a positive experience.

358
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:12.600
Jessica Zaleski: i'm going to go ahead and share my screen now, so you guys can see I know it's a little tiny i'll zoom in a little bit here, if I can, can I see one once.

359
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:24.990
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, I can see it all right good I think if I go to 200 it's going to be too big okay so somebody said I participated more after that so.

360
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:33.930
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe that wasn't such a negative experience, someone said I feel ashamed, I thought I wouldn't participate anymore, but i'm participating.

361
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:46.410
Jessica Zaleski: So this person worked through that dealing that's great um oh math class in elementary I tried to explain but couldn't and she made me hate math class.

362
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:54.450
Jessica Zaleski: wow that is understandable though kind of confused by putting me on the spot, I didn't like it.

363
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:02.790
Jessica Zaleski: Anxious because I didn't know the answer I was more likely to participate, because I wanted to get done with it fast.

364
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:11.700
Jessica Zaleski: that's interesting that is really interesting and understandable like if you know you have to participate, maybe you just want to be the first one to go and get it over with.

365
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:31.530
Jessica Zaleski: All right, Mr you want to read some of these more makes me feel unprepared struggling and confusing I was less likely to participate, after that, so, then you associate that uncomfortable feeling after I felt better because, when my teacher challenged me I talked more.

366
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:35.850
Susan Snay: about the topic and learn more that's that is interesting.

367
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.190
brave I felt brave I haven't done it in a while oh.

368
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:46.950
I was feeling so good, when I got to tell my opinion.

369
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.270
This is big you want to read something or.

370
00:48:52.350 --> 00:49:08.040
Ms. B: You want me to keep going sure um I feel good, I would like to participate that's very good it depends on what my answer is, and if the question from the teacher is difficult for me, but I would not feel nervous if I don't know the answer.

371
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:18.390
Ms. B: Very good it's always good to at least try, even if it is a difficult one very good it felt good I wanted to be questioned and prove my point.

372
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:27.390
Ms. B: wow that's really good when someone challenges, you and you want to be questioned, even more so you can get to the heart of the matter that is very good.

373
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:35.940
Ms. B: more likely to participate that's very good to hear, yes, because I didn't want to talk after because it made me feel stupid.

374
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:52.080
Ms. B: Oh, never let it make you feel stupid never let it make you feel stupid you don't have to know the answer always feel like you have the right to participate and your words are worth being heard, but I understand how you feel sometimes it kind of puts you on the spot.

375
00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:01.350
Susan Snay: So Mrs the actually said that there's a reason why we asked this question of you and.

376
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:11.160
Susan Snay: The reason that that we wanted to know how you felt was because we want you to know that when we do things in science in this class in this virtual science pod.

377
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:23.430
Susan Snay: There really isn't a right or wrong answer it's about your thoughts what you think and being able to explain your thinking that's what this is about it's not like a math problem where there's only one right answer.

378
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:34.950
Susan Snay: So that is not what this is like so try to be brave, like some of the students have said and share your thoughts, because your thoughts might prompt.

379
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:45.750
Susan Snay: Someone else to add to your thoughts and we might all get to the to get to answer that we all agree on together, we might create our own and that's what this is about.

380
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:56.370
Ms. B: kind of like with the models, we all don't have the key to what makes it work, but as each one of us were sharing our ideas someone else thought of something else.

381
00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:07.770
Ms. B: And then we revised and modified and added on to our model if they didn't if you didn't provide that additional feedback or things that you thought we may be left with a blank a blank piece of paper.

382
00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.230
Ms. B: No ideas.

383
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.200
Sarah Michaels: I want to say one quick thing sometimes when you you come out with an idea.

384
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.830
Sarah Michaels: And if if I were to say why do you think that.

385
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:31.110
Sarah Michaels: Or if miss renee was going to say how did you figure that out, or why do you, you know how did you get that you might think we're telling you you're wrong.

386
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:42.630
Sarah Michaels: But we're going to be asking why do you think that because we actually want to know why you think that so so sometimes when you get asked why.

387
00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:49.320
Sarah Michaels: Or you get put on the spot, you can get scared or it can feel bad because you feel like.

388
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:57.960
Sarah Michaels: You know, but when we say why we're curious it's not that we're testing you it's that we actually are interested.

389
00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:12.450
Sarah Michaels: And so we just wanted, we want you to know that we will ask you why do you say that or why do you think he he thinks that but it's, not because we think you're wrong it's because we actually want to hear why you think something.

390
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:20.280
Jessica Zaleski: And for those of you that put down that you feel felt ashamed when that happened, or you felt like you didn't want to participate.

391
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:27.720
Jessica Zaleski: I shared with Sarah, like the other day that when I first started working with misty and went to some training.

392
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:41.010
Jessica Zaleski: I was in a science class and that happened to me, I was being asked will tell me more, why do you think that, and I mean this was just a few years ago and I felt extremely anxious and I felt like wow.

393
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:49.800
Jessica Zaleski: I must not have the right answer, there must be a right answer and I don't have it, and it may be very anxious and uncomfortable.

394
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:57.660
Jessica Zaleski: And then I realized after like Okay, I know exactly what Sarah was saying it's not that there is a right answer it's just that.

395
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:05.520
Jessica Zaleski: These people genuinely want to know what I have to think and we're encouraging me to go public and share my ideas.

396
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:16.050
Jessica Zaleski: And so don't ever think through this process that like we are trying to push you towards a right answer, or like if you get if you say the wrong thing.

397
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:25.350
Jessica Zaleski: You know if we ask somebody else what they think it's not because you were wrong it's because we want to hear as many voices as we possibly can that's, the only way this works is if we get.

398
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:36.630
Jessica Zaleski: input and sharing from everyone Okay, so if you felt anxious and you wrote about that just kind of be brave, like some of the other people talked about and push through and it'll be worth it.

399
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:48.660
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, and it's going to actually help you in like all your classes in school because most of the time when teachers ask you why you think something it's not because they're trying to you know show you that you're wrong it's.

400
00:53:49.020 --> 00:54:01.650
Jessica Zaleski: That, even if you are wrong that talking about it can help other help you and help others learn, you know so that's super important Okay, I think we're going to share our models now right.

401
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:18.510
Jessica Zaleski: awesome, so I am going to go over to the jam board here and can everyone see the jam board now I can yep I can say wonderful Okay, so this happened to be my group we were in breakout Room one, so we were group one so.

402
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:26.310
Jessica Zaleski: knee Nikki and reggie you guys can take it away who wants to start explaining.

403
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.970
Jessica Zaleski: All right, reggie go for it.

404
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:43.080
Reggie: I so basically if you was um when you push like Dom the car back there's like a spring behind it and you won't like wind it up, and when you let go the spring Lee pushes it forward.

405
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.910
Jessica Zaleski: Okay Nikki or knee anyone want to add on anything there.

406
00:54:51.360 --> 00:55:04.320
Nhi Huynh: yeah so my idea was when we pulled the car that work a release it, I think that there is a force that help pushes the car go faster and further.

407
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.110
Jessica Zaleski: And needed you want to add anything.

408
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.850
I just ask a clarifying question.

409
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:29.580
How many springs Is that how many springs, or do you think are in the car i'm just.

410
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.000
You know I want to know how many other four springs.

411
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.490
Edwin Bermejo: one.

412
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.110
Susan Snay: One yeah okay just hundred.

413
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:50.910
Sarah Michaels: I had the same question it looks like it looks like there's a spring in the back, but it also looks like there's a spring in the front.

414
00:55:53.310 --> 00:56:04.740
Sarah Michaels: So, I guess, are you showing in the drawing there that it moves forward and kind of the wheels move are those the wheels or is that actually a spring.

415
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.610
Nhi Huynh: On bass actually a spring.

416
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.710
Susan Snay: That spring is is what you imagine on the inside of the car.

417
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:20.700
Sarah Michaels: yeah Okay, but there's one of them, not for.

418
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.410
Nhi Huynh: um I think there are four screens.

419
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:29.730
Sarah Michaels: Okay okay so who said there was one spring.

420
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:32.340
Jessica Zaleski: That was, I think that was someone from a different group.

421
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.050
Edwin Bermejo: yeah the different.

422
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:42.450
Sarah Michaels: Okay Okay, so therefore I that's interesting there for springs on each week there's a spring on each wheel.

423
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.750
Jessica Zaleski: write group one any thing else you want to add.

424
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.050
Reggie: No well he's not for me.

425
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:59.100
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, all right, so I guess we'll go on to group to.

426
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:06.600
Jessica Zaleski: me, and we have, and I can kind of zoom in on these one, at a time, if you know.

427
00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.790
Jessica Zaleski: We want.

428
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:16.800
Okay, so who, in our group, we have angie Chris.

429
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:27.150
Sarah Michaels: i'm not sure who's throwing the switch so who wants to go first who wants to explain this for them, we can point and we can ask Mrs de to kind of push that drawing up first.

430
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.910
Edwin Bermejo: I guess i'll go first all right go ahead, Chris.

431
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.050
Jessica Zaleski: That way.

432
00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:37.170
Edwin Bermejo: My job is not there.

433
00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:39.360
Edwin Bermejo: But for me thinking.

434
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:49.980
Edwin Bermejo: When I put the car backwards, I don't know if you get the same thing, but for me what you see is like a little hole inside you.

435
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.570
Edwin Bermejo: And then, when I let go the car.

436
00:57:55.770 --> 00:58:12.180
Edwin Bermejo: This little gear side here like a desk and moves with it so me thinking is at the wheel of these two wheels are credited to the middle and when I got back this gear helps it to push it by itself, because in the front it's connected to nothing just appalled with the wheels.

437
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:24.090
Susan Snay: Drawing in the top left, where it says group to at the bottom I believe isn't that what you that isn't that what we were looking at, we were looking at one of somebody else's drawing Edwin.

438
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.930
Edwin Bermejo: Yes.

439
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:29.670
Susan Snay: And that square in the middle, is that christopher's that yours, Christopher that you're you're.

440
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.540
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: Yes, yes, yes.

441
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:41.220
Susan Snay: Because, so they added on each other's as soon as Edwin said that opening in the middle and Chris says Oh, I think I know what you mean and he drew it.

442
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:48.180
Susan Snay: cool and then maybe how about Nora can you share something about yours.

443
00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:58.470
noora: For me, I tried and little bit like of details a little bit of sentences trying to expose happening.

444
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:09.300
noora: But I also tried drawing the threat of the wheels to show like how might look me from a different perspective, so one for the front with the top I was gonna do one for the back of the sites, but I didn't have time.

445
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:15.870
Jessica Zaleski: So, nor is this year's over on the right, yes Okay, I just want to rotate it yeah.

446
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.530
Sarah Michaels: Can you turn it.

447
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.270
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely, so let me.

448
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:20.070
Sarah Michaels: And i'll just.

449
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:23.670
Sarah Michaels: cool okay.

450
00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:27.210
Jessica Zaleski: Here here's connect and.

451
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:41.850
Sarah Michaels: So I have a question about nora's so I see that you have gears.

452
00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:45.150
Sarah Michaels: And I see.

453
00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:56.700
Sarah Michaels: That there's like a triangle there's something connecting the wheels, but do you have a spring in yours, or is it just gears connect and spins.

454
00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.130
Sarah Michaels: The pole.

455
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.690
Sarah Michaels: heard me.

456
01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:09.780
I forgot the springs existed I kind of forgot their thing, so I just didn't realize Oh, there might be a spring in here okay.

457
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.060
cool.

458
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:13.890
I.

459
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.310
have one more I just have to.

460
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:26.460
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you for moving those around for us no problem Okay, so now we have.

461
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.130
Jessica Zaleski: This must be angie's.

462
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.510
Sarah Michaels: wow that's beautiful the truck.

463
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:39.750
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, so there are the gears again angie you want to talk about this and explain it a little bit.

464
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.110
Is your microphone working okay.

465
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.300
Jessica Zaleski: We can't hear you angie angie can you try turning your camera off.

466
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:03.330
was working a little bit better during the group.

467
01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.850
Jessica Zaleski: Oh now she's got a camera off what we can't hear.

468
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.370
Anisha Hassan: Maybe she can type in the chat.

469
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.260
Jessica Zaleski: yeah angie can you type in the chat.

470
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.310
Anisha Hassan: Because her microphone was giving her trouble.

471
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.430
Sarah Michaels: I see she's written when you go back word.

472
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:25.500
Sarah Michaels: And when you go.

473
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:27.270
Jessica Zaleski: When you let it go.

474
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:28.530
Sarah Michaels: let it go.

475
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:35.280
Jessica Zaleski: Also, there are the gift so something's happening changing with the gears right in the.

476
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.690
backward.

477
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.830
Sarah Michaels: Then you let it go yeah it looks like something gets.

478
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:42.840
Sarah Michaels: dumped.

479
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.840
Ms. B: In that looks like the gears are going over each other.

480
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.880
Jessica Zaleski: mm hmm yeah and you can kind of see how the gears are inter playing here.

481
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.650
Jessica Zaleski: wow.

482
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.480
it's interesting that they both came up with this picture on their own.

483
01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.850
Jessica Zaleski: wow yeah.

484
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.730
Jessica Zaleski: Alright cool so i'm just going to move these kind of back and.

485
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:10.500
Jessica Zaleski: So now, you can see that you know we've already seen like one group came up with.

486
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:19.500
Susan Snay: The fact, they thought that maybe there was springs involved one or four now we've talked about some sort of years that might be in the middle.

487
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.170
let's check out another group.

488
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.250
Sarah Michaels: wow this holy cow.

489
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:36.180
Jessica Zaleski: string battery motor wow strings oh I didn't even think anything about a battery.

490
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:41.760
Jessica Zaleski: So yeah so who who wants to share from this group and explain.

491
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.580
Ms. B: So Salaam is going to be our presenter.

492
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.890
salam: So I can so what I think, so this is my thought I think there's a motor in there, and you.

493
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.370
will do.

494
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.310
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): Sorry.

495
01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:07.500
salam: You know these beers I think they're in the motor and you can't do Julie came out with the strengths that they're connected like into the water.

496
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.930
salam: And what we are and I think it was Kathleen or.

497
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.110
salam: Wait who was an art group that third 100 sorry.

498
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:30.270
salam: yeah I think gatlin came out with the old batteries, but I don't really think their batteries in there might be where we will never know, but like.

499
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:41.040
salam: Well, what I think the strength and the motor they're connected and the motor like kicks the strength and the gears and it starts moving forward.

500
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.800
salam: This is what I think.

501
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.470
Sarah Michaels: Oh yeah.

502
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:56.100
Ms. B: So what were you saying like when you pulled the car back what do you think is happening with those gears or the strings when you pull the car backwards.

503
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.780
salam: know what moons and.

504
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:11.910
salam: I think it depends on the speed of like the gears it depends on them like how many times like that turn, like to go forward, I mean when you look back, how much like you pull it back you know I mean.

505
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.260
Sarah Michaels: yeah yeah.

506
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:20.070
salam: And what I think down there like what is connected to the motor right there, I think I see right here.

507
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.910
salam: um I didn't know if you could really see.

508
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:25.620
salam: It see this.

509
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:27.030
Jessica Zaleski: zoom in a little bit here.

510
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.330
Susan Snay: Oh yeah your car upside down she's.

511
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.230
Jessica Zaleski: Holding oh she's holding.

512
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.330
Jessica Zaleski: Okay got it, I think.

513
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.300
Susan Snay: Edwin I think you were talking about the same thing right when you.

514
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.250
salam: See you see here.

515
01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.090
Sarah Michaels: yeah I.

516
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.460
salam: Think there's something like connected to the motor right here, so I drew it right there.

517
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:47.100
Edwin Bermejo: yeah that's what i'm thinking.

518
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:58.020
salam: And I like saw this white thing and that's what I think is the motor right there and I think it's metal and this, these are the gears right there that they covered the gears.

519
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.840
Jessica Zaleski: well.

520
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.680
Jessica Zaleski: All right, let's take a look at group number four.

521
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.860
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, my goodness wow.

522
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:19.110
Sarah Michaels: So Elio was going to can describe it, and then everybody else can jump in.

523
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.170
Sarah Michaels: Are you there.

524
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.760
Eliel Arbelo: Oh yeah.

525
01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:40.890
Jessica Zaleski: Can you explain the drawing a little bit for us the model Elio so like.

526
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:49.560
Eliel Arbelo: I personally think that there's like two gears or maybe three and that's connected to the back actually with this little box.

527
01:05:49.950 --> 01:06:03.030
Eliel Arbelo: So, every time you pull back the gears they start rotating Okay, and they the bottom, the top down the bottom one so that's what causes the tension in the axle so like once you get to a certain point it clicks and we let it go us to just launch as.

528
01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:07.170
Jessica Zaleski: Well, as that is amazing wow.

529
01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:07.620
Jessica Zaleski: So we.

530
01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.120
Ms. B: can introduce the actual.

531
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:19.740
Jessica Zaleski: yeah no kidding so I can see here like you're talking about this gear and this gear would pull this one down and create the tension is that what you're talking about Elio.

532
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:20.940
Eliel Arbelo: yeah close it back.

533
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:23.670
Jessica Zaleski: pulls it back okay wow.

534
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:30.330
Ms. B: Now, are those gears on top of each other side by side, side by side okay.

535
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:37.080
Susan Snay: And what is the circle in the middle there yep yep what is that circle right there.

536
01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:44.460
Eliel Arbelo: So that's one of the gears is they put in so it's a it's holding it in place so that's What moves with it.

537
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:49.620
Susan Snay: Okay, for that keeping the years from the players around I guess.

538
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.260
Eliel Arbelo: yeah okay as well.

539
01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.210
Ms. B: And what is the shifter bar.

540
01:06:55.470 --> 01:07:04.800
Eliel Arbelo: This is the box and say technically this thing right under the actual there's like these little teeth that hope to actually move when the user rotating.

541
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:11.280
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so because, so the tires around the axle.

542
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:18.810
Jessica Zaleski: yeah okay so that's why it has to move so is the axle spinning or just the tire spinning.

543
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.750
Eliel Arbelo: The actual the the whole thing moves around.

544
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:22.620
Okay.

545
01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:32.910
Sarah Michaels: And down and Sabina or Leandro or key Sean I mean we also had this idea that there was.

573
01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:42.690
Jessica Zaleski: Oh OK now we're talking about an amount of force that's being built up inside that that box that's drawn here.

Susan Snay: So this type of activity that we just did with this jam board.

634
01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:58.530
Susan Snay: is something that we would do in class also if the group was presenting they might have their whiteboard like the whiteboard behind us.

635
01:23:58.890 --> 01:24:09.750
Susan Snay: demonstrating their model and explaining it and then you are would have questions about specific things about this drawing so we want you to be brave enough to ask what you're thinking.

636
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:20.370
Susan Snay: i'm sure everybody is thinking something about these drawings that that each group came up with that they're a little bit different from yours, or maybe they're similar and you want to ask somebody about that.

637
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:28.920
Susan Snay: So this is what this is about is asking questions that you're thinking that don't just keep them in your mind actually say say what you're thinking.

752
01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.500
Leandro Graterol: Yes, yes, I will say that yeah.

753
01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.830
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we're gonna ask you, your thoughts on this because in.

754
01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:39.180
Jessica Zaleski: This was on the Internet and they accused the family and said that they were making it up, they couldn't possibly really be twins that biological twins twins that come from the same two parents, could not be this different.

755
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:47.820
Reggie: One of them must be adopted Okay, I think i'm the only like the orange here I think she might be like I know or something i'm not sure, though I could.

756
01:33:50.850 --> 01:33:53.340
salam: I could say like it.

757
01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:55.530
salam: Okay.

758
01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.580
salam: And my family, we all look different.

759
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:07.860
Jessica Zaleski: So you're using your own experience to say it's possible.

760
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:24.300
Susan Snay: we're going to be asking you about this yeah so underneath here says, have you encountered anything similar to this phenomenon among your friends family or acquaintances so you just said that yes, you have right.

761
01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:28.110
Ms. B: And, and when asked do they both have the same time.

762
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.440
Susan Snay: And I think that the previous topics, the question said that right.

763
01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.300
Jessica Zaleski: Now the scene by exactly so.

764
01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:45.510
Jessica Zaleski: There are biological twins that's the claim, so if they are biological twins then they have the same mother and the same father.

765
01:34:47.490 --> 01:34:56.250
Susan Snay: But a lot of people accuse them of fraud of saying that no one of them has to be adopted this can't be from the same mom and dad.

766
01:34:58.470 --> 01:35:14.160
Jessica Zaleski: So why don't you guys just type in the chat yes or no, have you ever seen anything like this siblings biological siblings brothers and sisters in this case sister and sister who look this different.

767
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.500
Ms. B: And Sean posted could the eggs have split.

768
01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:23.910
Jessica Zaleski: pea Sean.

769
01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:26.760
Sarah Michaels: Did you say a little bit more about you Sean.

Jessica Zaleski: And now, not mom but their moms mother their mom's mother is Jamaican and her father is northern European, so this is Lucy and maria's mom and her mom is Jamaican and her father is northern European.

818
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:20.940
Susan Snay: So that would be the girls, the twins that we saw their grandmother and grandfather on your mother's side mm hmm.

819
01:40:22.410 --> 01:40:22.860
Right.

820
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:48.930
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so now, what do you think, is it possible, knowing that information for Lucy and Maria to be biological twins take a moment and in your notebook write down your ideas explain why you think it is or is not possible for them to be twins based on what we just learned.

821
01:40:51.600 --> 01:41:02.820
Jessica Zaleski: So go ahead in your notebook explain why you think it is or is not possible for Lucy and Maria to be biological twins.

822
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:13.740
So don't be afraid to write down what you think one way or the other.

823
01:41:51.540 --> 01:42:01.680
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so now that you've had a minute to think about it and you've jotted some ideas down in your notebook what we'd like you to do is, you are going to type.

824
01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:20.010
Jessica Zaleski: Your idea in the chat but do not hit enter yet Okay, so what we'd like you to do is share your thoughts in the chat but do not hit enter yes it's possible and why or no it's not possible and why.

825
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:23.670
Jessica Zaleski: Just type it do not hit enter.

826
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:26.550
Susan Snay: we're all going to do it at the same time.

827
01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:30.060
yeah don't hit that enter or return yet.

828
01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:35.400
Jessica Zaleski: So no wait until I say go just typing now.

829
01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:39.810
Jessica Zaleski: it's a possible or not possible.

830
01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.590
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, about.

831
01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.260
Jessica Zaleski: 10 more seconds.

832
01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:07.830
Jessica Zaleski: 54321 go ahead and hit enter.

833
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:26.670
Jessica Zaleski: And I can't see the chat, so I think i'll start reading it yeah you'll have to fill me in it says Yes, they could be twins it's possible for Lucy and Maria to be biological twins but the difference in their parents was due to their grandparents right.

834
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:34.140
it's possible because they look like their grandparents, a lot of them are relating to the grandparents.

835
01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:40.200
I think it's possible because Lucy might have pigment on her skin.

836
01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.170
The parents are from different places So yes.

837
01:43:47.370 --> 01:43:52.650
We have also some knows, because they don't look anything like okay all right.

838
01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:57.990
Susan Snay: And then I have no idea.

839
01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:03.030
Susan Snay: I don't think that it's possible but i'm not sure.

840
01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:03.960
Okay.

841
01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:16.230
Sarah Michaels: Sean said something complex, yes, they could be twins, why is the grandmother on the mother's side is Jamaican and their father and grandfather are from northern Europe.

842
01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:20.400
Susan Snay: So there's a lot of there's a lot of different.

843
01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:23.040
Different.

844
01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.040
complexions and and.

845
01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:43.650
Jessica Zaleski: features that each of the grandparents have yeah and what i'm hearing is that a lot of people who said yes are connecting it somehow to the fact that Maria and lucy's grandparents on her mother's side.

846
01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:59.640
Jessica Zaleski: Are from you know ones from Jamaica and ones from northern Europe, so one is Caucasian and one is not so okay so that's interesting so let's take a look at these pictures again.

847
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.690
How.

848
01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:08.520
Ms. B: angie and catlin thought that it's possible because Maybe it was genetic or hereditary hereditary.

849
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:12.780
Jessica Zaleski: ooh that's a great segue here because.

850
01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:13.680
Jessica Zaleski: How they.

851
01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:27.090
Jessica Zaleski: Look depends on the traits that they got from their parents traits let's talk about that word for a second does anybody kind of think they know what it means when we talk about traits.

852
01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:30.150
salam: I think like what is the similar thing.

853
01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.840
salam: Like like what's an example of maybe something that you think is a treat what I think it's like.

01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:55.620
Susan Snay: We don't know what.

859
01:45:55.710 --> 01:45:59.550

Jessica Zaleski: Sarah again yeah.

985
01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:14.040
Jessica Zaleski: i'm just thinking, like the problem that i'm seeing is like Nora turns it on and then just immediately turns it off.

986
01:59:14.190 --> 01:59:31.050
Ms. B: So I asked she keeps turning it on and off and i'm caitlin chill in the breakout room she'll cut it off, but when you get to the main session she starts with it on but you can't see her and then she turns it off so and usually she'll keep it on with that black screen.

987
01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.190
Sarah Michaels: I don't think.

988
01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:34.140
Ms. B: He has ever show.

989
01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:35.580

Ms. B: Just a black screen, but she has the camera on.

991
01:59:39.210 --> 01:59:39.570
Sarah Michaels: Right.

992
01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:57.840
Ms. B: So and Kathleen was I know the first date when we did the breakout rooms, she said she's trying to get over her shyness she said she's usually pretty shy, so it it feels uncomfortable and she's anxious when she turns the camera on but she's going to keep trying that's what she had stated.

993
01:59:58.590 --> 02:00:01.710
Raquel Fernandes: Should we try to encourage them to keep your cameras on and breakout.

994
02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:08.130
Raquel Fernandes: breakout rooms asking to oh here it's like less people so it's more of a safe environment, maybe.

995
02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:13.590
Sarah Michaels: yeah Nora was really totally willing to talk, I think.

996
02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.850
Sarah Michaels: I don't know what did she ever camera on.

997
02:00:18.090 --> 02:00:20.460
Ms. B: turns out in the main session, but I know she.

998
02:00:20.610 --> 02:00:22.890
Ms. B: She flips on she flips on and off.

999
02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:26.850

Sarah Michaels: At a certain point, we do want to I mean it gets contagious when they if we if we say look it's really, really, really important, it seems like others have come gotten okay with it.

1007
02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:03.540
Jessica Zaleski: yeah angie I mean she had her camera on.

1008
02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.110
mosaic.

1009
02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:18.750
Jessica Zaleski: And she is extremely shy, but you know I don't know I to me to like I, I just want to encourage them to be responsible for the commitment that they made like again they.

1010
02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:25.260
Jessica Zaleski: They agreed to this, and so you know it's not that i'm not sensitive.

1011
02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:39.360
Jessica Zaleski: To the issue, but I I don't think that we can just let this go right, you know I don't think it's fair i'm just concerned, because with this remote learning that we've experienced this year it always seems like we lower the.

1012
02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:48.180
Susan Snay: bar now each time that some challenge comes up and the bar just keeps getting lower and lower until it doesn't exist anymore right.

1013
02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:58.260
Susan Snay: And, and I know they're not going to see a paycheck till the end, but it really that that's what this is, this is about about a commitment that they are going to be paid for right.

1014
02:01:58.890 --> 02:02:06.270
Ms. B: I think it would have been helpful helpful, I mean we had to obviously stay the course but we didn't actually have the opportunity to.

1015
02:02:06.810 --> 02:02:21.360
Ms. B: revisit the norms of what the actual established norms are going to be so we could put in our point where our only norm, was that you're required to keep your camera on and then incorporate all the parts that they added so maybe at this point, it may be time to.

1016
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:39.510
Ms. B: Now, with that that our only norm, that we require is that your camera is on and then you add the other parts that they contributed for what they expect in the session and hopefully that will be all they need, and if it's not then obviously there's a different conversation to have.

1017
02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:52.020
Jessica Zaleski: I think we could we should definitely start with that tomorrow, I just I don't know that I agree with, like the only norm is that they have to turn their camera on because I we want them to unmute and talk as well.

1018
02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:58.170
Jessica Zaleski: As much as they can like I think you know understanding to that like sometimes it's sometimes their mics aren't working.

1019
02:02:58.350 --> 02:03:04.230
Jessica Zaleski: But we need to we want to see them making an effort, like i'm just as happy when I see someone's mouth moving and.

1020
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: Like they're unmuted and they're trying, and I know that's frustrating, but we can tell that they're trying and then, if it's.

1021
02:03:10.170 --> 02:03:21.120
Jessica Zaleski: If it's the technology it's not their fault, you know we've all experienced that but for them to just type in the chat because that's the default that they go to that.

1022
02:03:22.050 --> 02:03:31.860
Ms. B: texting no that wasn't that wasn't the only norm, remember, we were talking about that, to make it seem as if we only have one requirement, because they they, in their own.

1023
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:42.180
Ms. B: Feedback said that you should talk, you should speak not only in the chat so we don't have to introduce that as our big our big Dave are you interested so make.

1024
02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:56.130
Ms. B: The only thing that we ask is that we see your faces with your cameras on and contribute their portions because they said that that's what the session should be like, so I would assume that they would try to adhere to the norms that they established to yeah.

1025
02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:10.350
Jessica Zaleski: So i'll make like a slide tomorrow kind of like our vsp norms and take everything that they had an ad ours, and you know, make it visual and just try to say okay like just we just want to remind everyone, you know of this to start.

1026
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:34.170
Sarah Michaels: And do we do we want to at some point, say this, this is the the job, and you can get paid I don't know it just makes me feel like they're they're taking advantage of a situation where they know they can get away with the minimum and that's sort of not what we want this to be about.

1027
02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:36.960
Ms. B: I think, once you establish the norms go ahead.

1028
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:46.290
Susan Snay: yeah I wonder if any of them are more closer closer friends, then you know that they know each other, a little bit I mean, some of them were texting each other, maybe they can each convince each other to do that.

1029
02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:49.500
Sarah Michaels: yeah or at least we want to sort of, say, look.

1030
02:04:52.260 --> 02:05:04.200
Sarah Michaels: let's talk about the commitments we've made and how we're going to live up to them and let let's let's really have a this is this is.

1031
02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:06.870
Jessica Zaleski: All we can say, do you think it's fair.

1032
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:20.580
Jessica Zaleski: That everyone got the same stipend if they are not participating equally I mean really that's kind of what we're asking ourselves right now right is it fair like did they think it's fair.

1033
02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:25.650
Jessica Zaleski: You know I when I went to deliver julie's.

1034
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:36.570
Jessica Zaleski: package, she knew I was coming I had texted her Okay, she knew I was coming, and then I got to her house and I waited outside her house for 25 minutes.

1035
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:47.850
Jessica Zaleski: texting and calling she did not come down Finally I said okay i'm gonna go and then she texts me a few minutes later and says.

1036
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:57.330
Jessica Zaleski: Where are you, you know, and I said I weighed it and then I actually turned around and went back, I mean there was like no i'm sorry no like.

1037
02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:02.940
Jessica Zaleski: And I don't i'm not like upset with her, I mean she's a teenager you know what I mean like I got it but.

1038
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:16.560
Jessica Zaleski: It didn't show, like every other student was like waiting to come out, they were excited I don't feel like she's invested in this in any way she like took the bag, for me it was like okay so.

1039
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:31.230
Jessica Zaleski: that's my concern is I just with the others, I felt like there was a higher level of buy in and with her, I don't I didn't feel that from the get go so i'm not sure you know I don't know.

1040
02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:50.370
Raquel Fernandes: Unless last class a lot of them had to cameras on but this class a lot of them stopped, so I wonder if we could try to again like also say the norms in a big group, but they Saturday prefer to be talked to individually.

1041
02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:55.410
Raquel Fernandes: For those kind of things so maybe we could maybe I could talk with kaplan.

1042
02:06:56.010 --> 02:07:12.510
Raquel Fernandes: In Portuguese like a private message and maybe we can like also all of us we see whoever is better whoever has a better relationship to approach them and see what's going on, maybe like demonstrating that we care and we want to encourage them for their benefit not just ours.

1043
02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:30.480
Sarah Michaels: yeah really The funny thing is the whole thing is for their benefit, I mean I don't care if we get good video or you know I I really think this is an opportunity, and I want them to somehow.

1044
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:40.890
Sarah Michaels: make a shift and make a you know become their best self and i'm seeing it in lots of them, I mean just.

1045
02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:48.180
Jessica Zaleski: Well, have you seen in when you've been in a breakout room and the cameras are on the difference and the dynamic in the room it's.

1046
02:07:48.960 --> 02:08:01.920
Jessica Zaleski: completely different, you know it just the conversation flows, I mean it's just so hard to talk in a breakout room when you can't see each other and you just don't know when someone's gonna there's no body language to.

1047
02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:13.560
Sarah Michaels: read it all, I think we have to put a stop to that the other thing is in the breakout rooms, we should say you can stay unmuted because it's a small group now if you need to mute I know.

1048
02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:26.730
Sarah Michaels: Salaam was having trouble in the background, and so, she was great she you know was really loud and she would say what but, but if they if that's not the issue they can just keep it you unmuted and just talk.

1049
02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:37.650
Sarah Michaels: I don't know raquel you are so patient, and so, and I was getting come on guys, this is your response, this is your agreement.

1050
02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:46.950
Raquel Fernandes: I had some practice because when I was a piano Clark, my group really didn't want to share it at all, like most of the days I would be talking with the wall and it's okay.

1051
02:08:47.970 --> 02:08:50.190
Sarah Michaels: So yeah I I guess.

1052
02:08:50.490 --> 02:09:00.690
Raquel Fernandes: I have a suggestion, maybe in breakout rooms, we could separate those students that are doing this, so we don't have a group that is just dodge like we had today.

1053
02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:07.650
Raquel Fernandes: yeah and maybe they will be encouraged by seeing the other students speak in with their cameras on to also do the same.

1054
02:09:08.190 --> 02:09:18.390
Anisha Hassan: Now we do that, could you just give me the names of students who you think should be like separated out or like not separated out, but just one big thing with others.

1055
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:27.180
Sarah Michaels: Well catlin didn't turn her camera on and she should be with raquel yeah and.

1056
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:30.150
Jessica Zaleski: Now Leo.

1057
02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:32.730
Jessica Zaleski: Does Elio I mean he has it on sporadically but he.

1058
02:09:32.730 --> 02:09:34.050
Ms. B: yeah he's on and off.

1059
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:54.030
Jessica Zaleski: yeah I would I I don't think it's good for him to be with you the other thing is, I can even see like the phones and you know so as soon as the cameras go off, you know that the phones are taxing and stuff going on, so um so yeah usually have Len.

1060
02:09:54.090 --> 02:09:57.780
Jessica Zaleski: Really ldl or or raw.

1061
02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:06.570
Ms. B: um and yeah it goes back and forth because angie sometimes and sometimes yeah and sometimes Sabina but not all the time.

1062
02:10:06.930 --> 02:10:07.710
Jessica Zaleski: yeah like.

1063
02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:10.770
Jessica Zaleski: angie today, it was a lot of technical issues.

1064
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:11.760
Ms. B: Because tech and.

1065
02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:12.720
Jessica Zaleski: camera on Friday.

1066
02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:14.940
Ms. B: Yes, something like she really wanted to be an.

1067
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:19.020
Ms. B: active participant today and technology was just failing her left.

1068
02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:19.350
Ms. B: And right.

1069
02:10:19.770 --> 02:10:23.370
Ms. B: I felt bad because she wanted to talk she wanted you could tell yeah.

1070
02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:24.360
Ms. B: Today was the day.

1071
02:10:24.570 --> 02:10:25.500
It was sad.

1072
02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:37.290
Anisha Hassan: Right and she actually came in and fix your microphone and talk to us in our small group and then she tried to go for it was just I just feel bad because technologies.

1073
02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.360
Ms. B: yeah technology was not her friend.

1074
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:46.290
Sarah Michaels: So let me just ask a question about that is that a problem with her bandwidth is that a problem with her chromebook.

1075
02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:58.830
Ms. B: Who knows it could be, it could be chromebook because at this point i'm in the meeting on my HP I couldn't get anything so you said you invited me to the class so i'm like hey i'll do it from my chromebook.

1076
02:10:59.070 --> 02:11:12.960
Ms. B: dead couldn't get anything wouldn't connect to the wi fi had some block on it from the administrator So when I left during the break it was because I went to go closer to my server had to reset all the settings in order to get it to accept.

1077
02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:22.470
Ms. B: The wi fi so I could I can just imagine, in some cases, what these kids are going through, if i'm doing it with a school issued computer to a teacher yeah.

1078
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:28.710
Jessica Zaleski: The other thing is to I know like angie where she lives in a massive apartment complex.

1079
02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:32.820
Jessica Zaleski: A whole lot of the students who live in those apartment multi you know.

1080
02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:33.960
Ms. B: Multi level lock.

1081
02:11:34.170 --> 02:11:38.790
Jessica Zaleski: plexus they are having so many issues with wi fi I say.

1082
02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:42.720
Jessica Zaleski: If they've got a hotspot from school they can't get the signal.

1083
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:45.390
Jessica Zaleski: yeah well that could be the case with her.

1084
02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:57.900
Ms. B: there's yeah I have one kid that uses their mobile hotspot from their cellular device to get it on to their chromebook because the free one doesn't work for them and then they get extra fees for that, because it's outside of their plan.

1085
02:11:58.170 --> 02:12:08.880
Sarah Michaels: So, I guess, my question was is there anything, given that Western is getting some more money for technology is there anything we could do quickly for a kid like angie but.

1086
02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:12.240
Jessica Zaleski: Fast while the best thing we can do is ask her.

1087
02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:20.640
Jessica Zaleski: And i'll send her an email tonight and i'll just I will say to her, you know Thank you so much for having your camera on we know you wanted to participate.

1088
02:12:20.970 --> 02:12:37.950
Jessica Zaleski: What device, are you using and do you have a hotspot because I mean, at least as of last week, we still had hot spots that we were able to give out so if we can get a hot spot for her and get it to her, then you know that might help I don't know.

1089
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:44.730
Ms. B: I know there were a lot of students that actually did have to bring their chromebooks Back to School to have them reset yeah yeah.

1090
02:12:45.630 --> 02:12:54.030
Jessica Zaleski: And it's possible to this is the other thing, some of these kids never turn their chromebooks off, so if you're not getting the resets.

1091
02:12:54.240 --> 02:13:02.670
Jessica Zaleski: There are their hotspot and restart their chromebooks like they think just closing it reset and know they need to go and log out.

1092
02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:09.300
Jessica Zaleski: And started, because every weekend they're running updates like the district pushes out updates and everything so.

1093
02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:19.740
Jessica Zaleski: We we probably should be reminding the students, because this is a kind of captive audience small group, like it's so important that you're doing this, you know so when you leave today.

1094
02:13:20.070 --> 02:13:35.640
Jessica Zaleski: You know, after vsp go ahead and completely don't just close your chromebook sign out of your chromebook shut it down leave it for a little while and then open it, but you know do it before 720 in the morning, when you need to be in class on Monday morning because.

1095
02:13:36.210 --> 02:13:36.780
Jessica Zaleski: A few minutes.

1096
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.610
Jessica Zaleski: well.

1097
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:53.820
Sarah Michaels: How did it go with others, small groups, I mean our kids don't know anything they literally they just sat on know how it would happen it happens, you know you get some from your dad and some from your mom they just didn't have any.

1098
02:13:53.880 --> 02:14:05.490
Jessica Zaleski: I just noticed that Sabina private messaged me spur matters oh so like my group, got to the awkward stage of when because they were talking about maybe it goes through the umbilical cord, and I said oh that's.

1099
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:14.040
Jessica Zaleski: Like they didn't know the term, they were talking about the thing that goes from the mother yeah and I said oh Okay, but alright, so what is the dad like have to do with it.

1100
02:14:14.370 --> 02:14:19.020
Jessica Zaleski: And then, and then they got to egg oh there's an egg from the mother Okay, and I said oh.

1101
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:25.290
Jessica Zaleski: So the extra mother like does the dad contribute and Edwin saving their home, you know, and I said I said.

1102
02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:37.860
Jessica Zaleski: i'm not asking like like I think we know like there are things that you know animals do we don't have to talk about that, but like how like does the dad give something and like that's the point and that's when she direct messaged me.

1103
02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:44.070
Jessica Zaleski: But they like Salam didn't even know what the word was, I think she was like chomping at the bit to go ask her mother.

1104
02:14:44.070 --> 02:14:44.460
Sarah Michaels: about it.

1105
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:51.930
Jessica Zaleski: But I think like it was in it, this happens every time right they get to that yes, heard like looking at each other, like.

1106
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:57.060
Ms. B: To say keep it PG 13 ID in reggie's eyes.

1107
02:14:57.090 --> 02:14:58.470
Ms. B: yeah where it was going.

1108
02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:01.020
Ms. B: Yes, and I said reggie.

1109
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:02.700
Ms. B: PG 13 and he goes.

1110
02:15:06.150 --> 02:15:11.070
Jessica Zaleski: We don't exactly want to know how to know what it is.

1111
02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:13.740
Jessica Zaleski: So.

1112
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:17.310
Ms. B: And it was crazy, because then Christopher did his little like yeah.

1113
02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:19.740
Jessica Zaleski: The skulk yeah.

1114
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:20.400
Exactly.

1115
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:37.500
Jessica Zaleski: So, so that was, and you know, some of them are going to go like Google This obviously are asked so and that's but um I don't know I thought it was interesting we got a lot of like DNA from the blood from the DNA.

1116
02:15:37.590 --> 02:15:47.550
Jessica Zaleski: Just Rom you know so and that was that just those were there first thoughts, so I guess my question because i'm gonna have to i'm good, I have to read, but um.

1117
02:15:48.300 --> 02:16:01.530
Jessica Zaleski: Do we want how much time we're going to start with norms, tomorrow, we agree on that, and then how much time, if any, do we want to give back in these rooms, can we not want to and do we want to just take this.

1118
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:07.110
Jessica Zaleski: and start to descend go through and discuss it and then start to build our model from their.

1119
02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:09.900
Ms. B: Their group that didn't get to put anything down, though.

1120
02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:15.510
Jessica Zaleski: yeah they'll go for did they as they ended up it didn't show up, but when I looked again it was there.
