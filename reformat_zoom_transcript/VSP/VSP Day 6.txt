4
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.570
Sarah Michaels: me sure what do you think yeah I think it would be great to give her the recording because there was some cool stuff that happened.

5
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.500
yeah.

6
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.370
Anisha Hassan: um do you want to cut off the part afterwards I mean we didn't.

Sarah Michaels: yeah yes okay yeah.

8
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.730

Raquel Fernandes: I can put it no problem.

12
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.650
yeah.

13
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.000
Jessica Zaleski: You know what we did not do yesterday that we really need to do today is, we did not do the discussion map.

14
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.130
Sarah Michaels: Oh.

15
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:11.970
Jessica Zaleski: Wait after we welcome them today, we should start with that because that's what we were supposed to do I, I felt so bad I just like launched right into the slide deck and then I was like oh.

16
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.780
Susan Snay: I thought about that, when I was like trying to go to sleep and like we never did that.

17
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.650
Susan Snay: yeah why we didn't have the participation that we expected.

18
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.260
Sarah Michaels: And i'm so sorry that I said at some point wait do they understand you know and just i'm so glad you just said, well we're going to do that later oh.

19
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.790
Jessica Zaleski: Well, I know, no see.

20
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.640
Jessica Zaleski: But it was awkward how we I don't know like I still know that was good that you said that because I couldn't exactly remember but i'm looking ahead at the slides on my other computer kind of going Okay, where this is where.

21
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:51.480
Sarah Michaels: It makes total sense, in the end, I mean I thought, like, why are we just letting them flounder around, but I feel like it really did pay off in some sense.

22
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.400
Jessica Zaleski: It did, because then, when they said.

23
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.130
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, they have to have the same number, we could go back and they could identify what they did wrong and yes.

24
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:10.500
Susan Snay: There are a lot of the things in the statements now in the in the model that we could probably go back, I was looking back through them and, like taking little notes, about which ones are just really definitions.

25
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.860
Jessica Zaleski: And not.

26
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.280

75
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:43.200
Sarah Michaels: they're part of part of our our norms with you guys as science ambassadors science leaders is bravery and so it's hard sometimes but it's worth it to take you know, take a chance, we were all we're all good buddies here.

105
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:48.570
Jessica Zaleski: dedication okay so looking good on the supplies Thank you alright so miss ne I this is shared and in our folder so you'll be able to see my mom yep exactly.

106
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.190
Jessica Zaleski: But it looks like it's going to be.

107
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.420
Jessica Zaleski: A small list so.

108
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.170
Jessica Zaleski: that's great.

109
00:11:52.560 --> 00:12:02.310
Jessica Zaleski: Now um what else did we not talk about yesterday that they should have ideally but it's not necessary necessary okay.

110
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.240
So.

111
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:16.770
Susan Snay: The best thing to us is a piece of soft fruits to do DNA extraction so strawberries were worked really well yesterday I experimented with an orange I was eating and I extracted the DNA from that.

112
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:37.320
Susan Snay: On my counter didn't measure anything and it worked out perfect mango papaya anything soft works really well okay don't go out and buy any any fruit specially just for this, so if you have something already great if you don't you can actually use the inside of your cheek.

113
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:48.480
Susan Snay: Okay, you know you all have living skin cells inside there and it's Nice and soft and if you if you kind of like just scratch the inside of me like bleed I just.

114
00:12:49.650 --> 00:13:01.260
Susan Snay: Like a toothpick or your nail and then use that you can get some cells, out of that it doesn't give you as good of a DNA extraction but it'll work so don't go out and buy anything special because y'all have a cheek okay.

115
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:10.320
Jessica Zaleski: I didn't put that in the Google form because if you have some fruit now, you might not have it by next Saturday, if your House is anything like mine, someone will eat it between now and then.

116
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:19.260
Jessica Zaleski: And that's fine, but you know if you're if you're at the store later next week or when on Saturday, when we go to do the lab if you have a piece of soft fruit.

117
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.020
Jessica Zaleski: that's great, but you don't need to go out and buy fruit for this lab you.

118
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.910
Susan Snay: Take a piece that you have now and just put it in a bag in the freezer and just leave and hide it.

119
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:30.690
For national.

120
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.750
Jessica Zaleski: got a strawberry in your House hide it.

121
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:43.470
Jessica Zaleski: All right, great it's going to be fun, I honestly when I heard about this lab I did not understand at all.

122
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:54.090
Jessica Zaleski: What we were going to be doing i'm not going to give it away but let's just say misnamed shared it with me and I was super excited I haven't done it yet either, but I can't wait to do it.

123
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.390
Jessica Zaleski: I cannot, I want to have that experience with you guys, for the first.

124
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.290
Jessica Zaleski: time I did it.

125
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.670
Susan Snay: For the first time with an orange I didn't know if it would work or not, but it's going to be cool yeah.

126
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.520
Jessica Zaleski: So all right so uh nisha can you share.

127
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.960
Jessica Zaleski: Sarah do you want to kind of set up what we're going to talk about next.

128
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:23.280
Sarah Michaels: i'm sure I remember when we talked about norms and what kind of virtual science pod we wanted to have.

129
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:37.920
Sarah Michaels: One of the things we felt really strongly about and it's why we asked you guys to turn your cameras on is we really wanted people to be able to share their ideas and express themselves and ask questions and so.

130
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:53.310
Sarah Michaels: We have we have been paying attention to who talks and who talks to the whole group or who talks to another person and we're very excited to see when anyone talks at all.

131
00:14:53.970 --> 00:15:02.430
Sarah Michaels: And so we've been tracking the call it a conversation map and It just shows who talks over the course of the session

132
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.490
Sarah Michaels: And so we wanted to show you how it looked on the first day and then how its looked.

133
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:28.020
Sarah Michaels: Later, and later because it shows some really interesting and we want you to see it and think about it and see if you notice any patterns, or if you're pleased, or, if you want us to do you want to work harder on things you know just gives you a mirror to see how the talk was happening.

134
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.360
sure.

135
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.830
Anisha Hassan: So this is day one.

136
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:45.630
Jessica Zaleski: So there we have all the participants in the vsp their names all around the perimeter.

137
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:57.390
Jessica Zaleski: And then, in the middle, it says it's a little hard to read, but it says whole group so that's if you were talking to the whole group there's a line going from your name into the middle.

138
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:04.260
Jessica Zaleski: If you were talking to another person directly there's a line going from your name to that person's name.

139
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.790
Jessica Zaleski: So what do you notice about this conversation map.

140
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.380
This a lot of lines in there.

141
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.660
Jessica Zaleski: Any other noticing.

142
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:31.920
Nhi Huynh: I noticed that there are certain people that talk a lot like in the whole group, and there are not a lot of people talking with the whole group.

143
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:44.730
Jessica Zaleski: Specifically nicki who do you notice, who do you think based on that conversation map, who talked to the most.

144
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.560
Jessica Zaleski: first session.

145
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.670
Jessica Zaleski: saloon Okay, she who else.

146
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.670
Nhi Huynh: Sarah right.

147
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.850
Nhi Huynh: Miss butcher.

148
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:57.780
yeah.

149
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.120
Nhi Huynh: Miss.

150
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.180
Jessica Zaleski: You can just say the names that are on there.

151
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.050
Jessica Zaleski: yeah yeah.

152
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.700
Nhi Huynh: Miss just um.

153
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.730
Nhi Huynh: And me yeah.

154
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.440
Sarah Michaels: yeah so reggie I lot of yeah.

155
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:26.250
Jessica Zaleski: But it's kind of filled in more over by Miss nay and me so i'm looking thinking, while we talked a lot, and some people didn't talk at all the first day.

156
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.390
Jessica Zaleski: But now, if a nisha shares.

157
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.610
Jessica Zaleski: The second session, which was just the next day.

158
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.770
Jessica Zaleski: Look at this.

159
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.560
Jessica Zaleski: What do you notice about this.

160
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.730
salam: This year, the motion.

161
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.010
Jessica Zaleski: I talked the most.

162
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.790
Edwin Bermejo: More people talk to more people participate yeah.

163
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.560
Jessica Zaleski: I think there's a line from every single name right.

164
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.500
Sarah Michaels: I think everybody in the group talked.

165
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.420
Sarah Michaels: And some hadn't talked at all before talked quite a lot.

166
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.940
Jessica Zaleski: Is there anything you notice about the direction of the lines.

167
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.350
Reggie: It looks like a We talked to like another person at some point, you know just the whole group.

168
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:30.450
Jessica Zaleski: yeah I noticed that to reggie there are a lot more lines going from person to person, instead of just person to whole group.

169
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.210
Sarah Michaels: Some people say that when when the conversation is going well, it should look like a hot miss.

170
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:53.340
Jessica Zaleski: Some people call the spider web maps, you know, and they should if it looks like a spider web, there would be lines going in every you know direction from person to person, not just to the middle.

171
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.410
Jessica Zaleski: All right, how about day three So this is the third Sasha.

172
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.690
Reggie: Miss they talk to most.

173
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.980
Susan Snay: Like.

174
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.010
Reggie: The other one we tied to each other, but not as much as.

175
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.090
salam: It seems like every talk to the group.

176
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.710
Jessica Zaleski: All right, how about.

177
00:19:59.760 --> 00:19:59.940
salam: Like.

178
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.280
salam: More than others.

179
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.880
Jessica Zaleski: i'm having a really hard time.

180
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.060
Susan Snay: I got kicked off twice my computer just totally froze again.

181
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.090
Susan Snay: My I think I might have to actually go on my phone i'm going to try to see if that's any better.

182
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.310
Susan Snay: Sorry.

183
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.500
Leandro Graterol: Miss.

184
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.160
yeah.

185
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.960
Leandro Graterol: Oh.

186
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:56.280
Leandro Graterol: yeah so i'm sometimes i'm like I asked you something, but I don't if you can hear me all right answer is, or something better, you don't hear me I don't know it seems like.

187
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.790
Jessica Zaleski: you're thinking about this Leandro.

188
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:16.590
Jessica Zaleski: And I think that maybe this is i'm glad you brought this up Leandro because I think, maybe miss, nay and Sarah and Alma and a nisha and how cal need and I need to talk about this, I know, for me.

189
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:27.810
Jessica Zaleski: When i'm sharing my screen it's really hard for me to also be looking I can't see everybody else so it's hard for me to see if people unmute and talk.

190
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:39.300
Jessica Zaleski: So what i'm going to do for this session is if i'm sharing my screen I I might actually sign in on my other computer, so I can just share my screen on that and then keep.

191
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:52.260
Jessica Zaleski: Open here I don't know how that how that will work, but I know I felt like there were some people that didn't get heard yesterday, so one of us, as the as a teacher needs to just be making sure that we're monitoring that.

192
00:21:53.100 --> 00:22:08.490
Jessica Zaleski: more carefully, because we want to make sure everybody gets hurt, but another thing we can do, and I would encourage everyone to do this if you feel like you want you have something to share does everyone have the reactions buttons at the bottom, like the hand raise.

193
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.770
Leandro Graterol: Yes, yeah.

194
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.780
Jessica Zaleski: So go ahead and raise your.

195
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.720
Jessica Zaleski: hand if you're like ooh they didn't I don't think they heard me.

196
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.730
Jessica Zaleski: That will give us a visual cue to that would be really helpful.

197
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.010
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you.

198
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.630
Sarah Michaels: Another thing.

199
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:33.570
Sarah Michaels: i'm thinking about is that some people have been saying things in the chat and that's not shown here but.

200
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:42.660
Sarah Michaels: let's try, if we can to to speak our speak up when we can and then, but will also try to acknowledge.

201
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:58.350
Sarah Michaels: I don't know how it would work on the drawing but people are communicating are sharing ideas through the chat, which is also great it's but let's try to let's try to not rely on the chat and talk to each other, see how that goes.

202
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.310
Jessica Zaleski: That was the final map to share right in Asia.

203
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.050
Susan Snay: I just wanted everybody does know.

204
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.740
Susan Snay: Because I literally just found it.

205
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.860
Susan Snay: If I have to actually.

206
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:26.250
Susan Snay: go over to where it says participants at the bottom, and I have to click on participants when I do, that I see everybody's name.

207
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.410
Susan Snay: For the raise my hand.

208
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.260
Susan Snay: I don't see it down there until I go over participants.

209
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:48.630
Susan Snay: Okay, so if you can't find it do that go over to at the bottom, where it says participants kind of keep your cursor over it, or click on it, and then you probably get the list of everybody's names me yes okay.

210
00:23:49.740 --> 00:24:03.420
Jessica Zaleski: Good Thank you so much because everybody's does look a little different, I think, depending on what device they're using their signed in alright awesome i'm going to try to share my screen now on my other computer so.

211
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.660
Jessica Zaleski: Now i'm sharing from a chromebook.

212
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:08.970
Jessica Zaleski: Here we go.

213
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:19.020
Jessica Zaleski: This is where we kind of left off yesterday, I think, right now, I can see people um.

214
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.820
Jessica Zaleski: We were talking about if the pairs of chromosomes.

215
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:48.120
Jessica Zaleski: That we see were identical if this and this are exactly the same, and this, the two here, and the two here are exactly the same, and who could remind us of what the Group consensus was did we think they were exactly the same or they weren't exactly.

216
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.670
salam: The same they were not.

217
00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:04.140
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so Salam said they were not now can anyone else share a little bit more about that so Salaam said what the consensus was can anyone else share a little bit more about that.

218
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.310
Jessica Zaleski: Like why weren't they the same.

219
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:27.120
Jessica Zaleski: i'm just kind of scrolling through to see if anybody has a hand raised or wants to just unmute themselves.

220
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.390
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so on.

221
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:54.840
salam: it's different because each chromosome so first one, it comes right let's say comes from the dad the second one comes from the mom the first one comes from the dad second one comes from the mall so yeah and that one comes from the.

222
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.080
salam: mom Dan from the data.

223
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.330
salam: Okay.

224
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.320
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you alright so that's why they're not exactly the same.

225
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:21.000
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so there's our answer so know the pairs look alike, but their DNA is different because they came from two different people so here's a vocabulary word, they are called homologous.

226
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:31.560
Jessica Zaleski: homologous they code for the same traits but may they may have different versions of the traits.

227
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.910
Jessica Zaleski: I don't think they do you want to write this part, no, we have.

228
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:40.710
Susan Snay: Not.

229
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:50.670
Susan Snay: Yesterday, they also recognize that not only do the chromosomes come from two different parents, but we followed that back even further.

230
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.610
Susan Snay: While your generation to the grandparents.

231
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.550
Jessica Zaleski: Sadly, but when remember this, this was something that we talked about that was really important.

232
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:18.150
Jessica Zaleski: That in our bodies chromosomes are not red and blue we're using red and blue to represent those chromosomes but what color our chromosomes on an actual carrier Type one of those pictures of real chromosomes.

233
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.530
Reggie: We.

234
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.840
Jessica Zaleski: black and white.

235
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.300
Susan Snay: Video.

236
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.080
Susan Snay: Part of the part of the DNA.

237
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.180
Susan Snay: So there's a.

238
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.710
Susan Snay: pair of chromosomes that in there, these genes on this chromosome the penguins might be funding.

239
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.410
Susan Snay: These little dimples when you smile I don't have any.

240
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.610
Susan Snay: It might be for the blood that you have.

241
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:14.130
Jessica Zaleski: You can see how we have a chromosome that's coming from each of the parents to make the pair and maybe one parent has the G the version, for no dimples.

242
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:24.360
Jessica Zaleski: And the other parent has the gene for dimples This is where the dimples gene is located on this set of chromosomes.

243
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:49.110
Jessica Zaleski: And, depending on whether or not one or both parents have that version of the trait that's how it's going to show up So here we have a Maybe this could be the mother or father, with no dimples and type a blood and here's the other parent with the jeans with the gene.

244
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.570
Jessica Zaleski: For dimples.

245
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.580
Jessica Zaleski: They will have.

246
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:03.810
Susan Snay: And I think this is also key shine brought up something interesting too, because if these are chromosomes that you see it from your parents one parent.

247
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:22.800
Susan Snay: doesn't have the dimples June and one parent does have the devil's gene then which one, will you get you get dimples or notables and key Sean said in the chat earlier, maybe yesterday that sometimes genes are stronger or more dominant.

248
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:35.370
Susan Snay: So that's where this could actually come into play to maybe one of those chromosomes actually is more dominant and that's the gene that you'll have you'll see betrayed for.

249
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.090
Jessica Zaleski: yeah that's exactly true and it's hard to know.

250
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.550
Jessica Zaleski: Which one is stronger we.

251
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:55.410
Jessica Zaleski: don't scientist lot of discoveries about this, but you know, sometimes children inherit things that make them look a lot more like one parent or the other, and I love that analogy.

252
00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:01.830
Jessica Zaleski: That you use MySpace about the light switches can you share that one with the class because I thought that was really cool.

253
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:02.520
She.

254
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.330
Susan Snay: said that switches.

255
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:12.870
Susan Snay: Gene you have light switches in every single one that you go into.

256
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.610
Jessica Zaleski: can turn the light.

257
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:14.820
On.

258
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.030
Susan Snay: that she can turn them on and off.

259
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.200
Susan Snay: Right.

260
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.290
Susan Snay: turn the light switch on.

261
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:56.970
Susan Snay: genes are the same way, your genes can be turned on and turned off and sometimes that can sometimes they're never turned on sometimes they're turned on later on in life, and sometimes certain environmental factors can turn on these genes and change the trades that you have OK.

262
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:10.320
Jessica Zaleski: So the two different versions of DNA, for the same trait like the know dimples are devils or type a blood or type old line, those are called a wheel.

263
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:24.000
Jessica Zaleski: So illegals are different versions of the same tree, so you know you'll hear us talk in you know because we'll be talking about this again this year in class and you'll be hearing us talk about.

264
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:36.000
Jessica Zaleski: A lilo's for different traits and there's so many there's a wheels for eichler there's a wheels for oh I love, when we talk about if you have attached your logo.

265
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.750
Susan Snay: On attached.

266
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:46.830
Jessica Zaleski: ear lobes or if you know you have hitchhikers thumb and all these different things that you can you know if you there's different versions of these.

267
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:48.990
Jessica Zaleski: traits.

268
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.290
Susan Snay: ideals are all of the different.

269
00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:05.820
Susan Snay: types of that trait that you may see or even though you don't see, because this could be in five right look at blood type, for instance I can't look at you and see what kind of blood type you have right I don't see that.

270
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:22.320
Susan Snay: But inside and and and the doctors can actually win some cells and actually determine which type you have, so we have different types Those are all different for blood type for human blood type here color.

271
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:23.790
Susan Snay: Like.

272
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.490
Susan Snay: Alright So what do we got here.

273
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:38.820
Susan Snay: So to keep track with these letters and the letters in this case a four chromosomes that come from the mother, the person's mother or the female.

274
00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:53.730
Susan Snay: If we're not talking about humans and be coming from the person's Father so we're going to label or chromosomes the pair's showing us which one came from mom and which one came from dad that's going to make this a little bit easier.

275
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.090
Jessica Zaleski: So yeah So if I look at data here.

276
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.250
Jessica Zaleski: I see that chromosome one.

277
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:13.440
Jessica Zaleski: hey, this is the chromosome that this man got from his mother and one B is the same, the same chromosome chromosome one that he got from his father.

278
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:31.320
Jessica Zaleski: and so on and so forth Now this is interesting, we look at this third chromosome third pair of chromosomes how could you know, without seeing the A and B, which one came from mom and which one came from dad.

279
00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:33.660
salam: Is from.

280
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.250
Jessica Zaleski: How do we know that.

281
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.650
salam: The shorter one.

282
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.840
Susan Snay: We would know that it came from mom or dad.

283
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.460
Susan Snay: said, we talked about colors colors just to.

284
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:16.470
Susan Snay: separate them, but mainly the chromosomes don't have colors at all, but that's a good observation.

285
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.730
Susan Snay: What does mom have to smile chromosomes.

286
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.510
Leandro Graterol: A high level a little like saying I don't know how to Chicago.

287
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:48.030
Jessica Zaleski: yeah we'll talk about that we're going to talk about that in one second Leandro that's right do you guys remember when we when we practiced making that baby with the chromosomes yesterday in the purple circle.

288
00:34:48.630 --> 00:35:05.130
Jessica Zaleski: And how, when we dragged down the chromosome one from dad in the small pair and one for mom and the small pair it didn't matter which one came from mom right because mom only had moms were the same size.

289
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:26.700
Jessica Zaleski: What changed the sex of the baby was when it mattered which one dad gave right if dad gave the taller of the shortest ones, it was a female offspring if dad gave the smaller one it was going to be a male offspring Okay, so we always know if it's.

290
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:33.570
Jessica Zaleski: One of those pairs is going to have one that is taller and one that is smaller.

291
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.840
Susan Snay: Another way to think about this is.

292
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.450
Susan Snay: The smallest.

293
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:46.860
Susan Snay: Mass can we look at to the right hand side the blue smallest pair her to the same size.

294
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:56.010
Susan Snay: So what is the only thing the only size of that comes on that mom can give.

295
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:57.960
Susan Snay: us.

296
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:00.660
Susan Snay: A really short one to give.

297
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:01.920
salam: You.

298
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:17.220
Susan Snay: know so on me on the song three that mom can give is that one, the one that will code for an x she doesn't know why to give my dad was dying half.

299
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.670
Reggie: X and y.

300
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.930
Susan Snay: And y so he can give it to the offspring you guys starting to see it.

301
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:43.620
Jessica Zaleski: After really important question, he said, why is there this little symbol after the a and the B, so we use this symbol in science and we use it in math.

302
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:57.930
Jessica Zaleski: it's called a prime symbol, sometimes people call it like a tick mark, but this this we call it a crying or OK, so the mom if dad is one a.

303
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:14.220
Jessica Zaleski: We have to be able to tell the difference between Okay, which set of ones is from the dad in which set of one chromosomes that one is from mom okay.

304
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:21.330
Jessica Zaleski: So they're going to add this little privacy symbol here to show that all of these are my mom.

305
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:32.340
Jessica Zaleski: If we wanted to add another person to this array of chromosomes maybe look at their children, we might say a one a.

306
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:51.570
Jessica Zaleski: Double prime and there might be two little prime month after so it's just a way to categorize and organized in group Okay, so all of these because these have one prime mark they're all from the same person, these have no primer they're all from the same person.

307
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.900
Susan Snay: it's just a way of labeling them.

308
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.190
Susan Snay: Which is just a mark.

309
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.710
Right.

310
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.410
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so right now.

311
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.410
Jessica Zaleski: we've asked you guys to copy.

312
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.970
Jessica Zaleski: So we talked about.

313
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.120
Susan Snay: The first.

314
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.780
Susan Snay: The first, the first four letters.

315
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:37.080
Susan Snay: actually means same so every time you see a word that begins with homo.

316
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:47.100
Susan Snay: means seem right so homologous chromosomes of the same type so it's very helpful to remember that prefix.

317
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.010
Keyshawn: mom and dad have prime symbols.

318
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:07.860
Jessica Zaleski: So.

319
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:17.820
Jessica Zaleski: One of the parents should have Brian assembles yep it just depends on kind of where we're starting the first person that.

320
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:28.770
Jessica Zaleski: The first chromosome set that we're going to look at wouldn't have any prime symbols, but then as soon as we add another set of chromosomes from a different organism okay.

321
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:40.920
Jessica Zaleski: We need to add those PRIMES so we can tell the difference this will make a little bit more sense later on today, when we start actually moving them around you'll see why it's important to mark.

322
00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:48.060
Susan Snay: yeah it's just so that they can keep track of the different where the chromosomes are coming from they're coming.

323
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.280
Susan Snay: organisms.

324
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:57.120
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so Who are they coming from are they coming from the parent at these from the mother, father.

325
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.000
Jessica Zaleski: Where are they what do they belong to really.

326
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.970
Susan Snay: comes from Susan snake.

327
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.470
Susan Snay: sure.

328
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:33.510
Jessica Zaleski: So remember in a human, we have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes right those chromosomes are the same type they look alike.

329
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:45.030
Jessica Zaleski: And they contain information about the same traits but they have different versions we've got some from what some version from our father and some version from our mother.

330
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.280
Susan Snay: Just like that previous picture that is just he just showed you with the two chromosomes in.

331
00:40:51.630 --> 00:41:01.290
Susan Snay: One of those chromosomes from one of the parents had to do a gene, and the other homologous chromosome from from the mom didn't have it.

332
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.570
Jessica Zaleski: And illegals are those different versions of DNA, for the same traits.

333
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:25.800
Susan Snay: So what are all the possibilities of hair color or eye color for hair texture curliness straightness weakness Those are all o'neill's.

334
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.490
Leandro Graterol: We make copies.

335
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.670
Susan Snay: Yes, yes yeah.

336
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.880
Sarah Michaels: yeah that's helpful Salaam just wrote in the chat that she's done.

337
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.920
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yes, that is helpful if you.

338
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:32.310
Sarah Michaels: get your.

339
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.540
Sarah Michaels: thumbs up or you can.

340
00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.100
idea.

341
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.680
Susan Snay: On it it's it's probably fastest just to know yeah done yeah.

342
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.610
Susan Snay: But the chat works too.

343
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:59.220
Susan Snay: awesome.

344
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:00.840
Susan Snay: Thank you.

345
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.200
Jessica Zaleski: Okay we'll give it a few more seconds.

346
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.360
Susan Snay: Alright, so let's.

347
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:49.770
Jessica Zaleski: Take a look at.

348
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:53.550
Susan Snay: So.

349
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.220
Jessica Zaleski: When we made that baby yesterday.

350
00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:11.640
Jessica Zaleski: We picked the chromosomes and moved them right from the parent to the baby and at the at toward the end of our session yesterday, something interesting happened and I think it was Salaam.

351
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:21.600
Jessica Zaleski: She talked about how she didn't move the chromosomes from the parents to the baby Salaam What did you do instead.

352
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.060
salam: I copied and pasted them.

353
00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:32.310
Jessica Zaleski: yeah, why did you do that, why did it make sense to you to not move them into the baby, but to copy and paste.

354
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.910
salam: Because if I move them the mom and dad are not gonna have like three pairs you can have like.

355
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.810
salam: I copied them because I thought you.

356
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.310
salam: know.

357
00:44:47.460 --> 00:45:03.660
Jessica Zaleski: Why is that important let's see if someone else can expand on that a little bit and share it like, why is it important that the mom and dad have the same number of chromosomes as the baby, or that the baby have the same number of chromosomes.

358
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.980
Jessica Zaleski: As mom and dad.

359
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:05.460
Yes.

360
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.370
Leandro Graterol: You agree.

361
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.280
Jessica Zaleski: Or why is it important.

362
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.840
Jessica Zaleski: For the baby.

363
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:25.410
Jessica Zaleski: To have the same number of chromosomes that the mom and dad have or why is it important for the mom and dad to have the same number of chromosomes as the baby, in other words.

364
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.620
Jessica Zaleski: Why did Salaam thing she needed to just.

365
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.920
Jessica Zaleski: copy and paste and not just take those chromosomes.

366
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.690
Reggie: Because.

367
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:49.170
Reggie: hey so we said it was a mosquito right because I like to censor too so i'm Okay, if you took if you took off like maybe like once of that wouldn't be a mosquito anymore doesn't have the same amount chromosomes as you need to be mosquito, so I think that's why she copy and pasted it.

368
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.910
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so there's.

369
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:58.800
Jessica Zaleski: The parents have to have the same number as the child and the child has to have the same number as the parent.

370
00:45:59.280 --> 00:45:59.820
Leandro Graterol: yeah I think.

371
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.290
Leandro Graterol: Like.

372
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.250
Jessica Zaleski: Do you think it ever happened.

373
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.230
Jessica Zaleski: That i'm just gonna.

374
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:07.470
Susan Snay: help.

375
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:11.280
Jessica Zaleski: me move up here a little bit, I want to take a look, something you have thinking about happens.

376
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.270
That.

377
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:19.230
Susan Snay: Maybe an offspring gets different numbers of chromosomes their parents do.

378
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.650
Susan Snay: You think it can happen.

379
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:24.360
Reggie: No.

380
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:39.870
Jessica Zaleski: So we talked about how one of the things that we talked about yesterday when you are making your baby said that you had to make a viable business.

381
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:40.800
Susan Snay: Right.

382
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.890
Jessica Zaleski: So we talked about this idea of viability.

383
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.450
Jessica Zaleski: I said that means that it.

384
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.770
Susan Snay: It could be living.

385
00:46:46.830 --> 00:47:04.020
Jessica Zaleski: Right and then we looked at the chart of all the different organisms and how some you know humans have 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs and things like cotton the plant has 50 chromosomes so it's similar I mean it's close to number.

386
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.490
Jessica Zaleski: two.

387
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.070
Susan Snay: anything like me.

388
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.200
Jessica Zaleski: No, I don't look like cotton plant.

389
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.980
Jessica Zaleski: So what happens let's take.

390
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.340
Jessica Zaleski: A look.

391
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.500
Jessica Zaleski: Here, and another carrier type.

392
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:25.710
Jessica Zaleski: What do you notice about this stereotype first of all, what organism, do you think it is.

393
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.840
Reggie: On vacation.

394
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:36.450
Jessica Zaleski: What organism, do you think this stereotype is, you have to get.

395
00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:38.070
Reggie: To me man.

396
00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.650
Jessica Zaleski: Why do you think it's.

397
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.330
Susan Snay: Why, why do you think that.

398
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:48.000
Reggie: Because I see I see 23 pairs of chromosomes okay.

399
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:48.780
Okay.

400
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.790
Jessica Zaleski: 22 and then an x What else do you guys notice about.

401
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:55.830
Jessica Zaleski: This you mean karaoke.

402
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.340
Jessica Zaleski: I heard a couple people say something about.

403
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:08.430
salam: It.

404
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.570
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

405
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.610
Susan Snay: We see somebody just said.

406
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.620
Jessica Zaleski: X, Y.

407
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.780
Jessica Zaleski: doesn't have enough does it have a why.

408
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.770
Reggie: And also 23 pairs.

409
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:32.730
Susan Snay: Okay, so this is probably the things they are so can we go back to the X, Y when i'm a little confused on that one.

410
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:42.120
Jessica Zaleski: not know why so if you're why here and to access What else do we know about this area about this stereotype.

411
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.820
Jessica Zaleski: Well, is there a, why do you see a lot.

412
00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:55.440
Sarah Michaels: More.

413
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.820
Susan Snay: I don't see anything about the why.

414
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.180
Reggie: there's a wide there.

415
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:12.450
Susan Snay: Okay, so there's nothing about the label the why the mapping That means there isn't a chromosome there.

416
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.010
Sarah Michaels: I want me to stop.

417
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:17.850
Yes.

418
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:27.450
Leandro Graterol: racking your your maze What do you say.

419
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.890
Sarah Michaels: I want need to say what she said before.

420
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.260
I think.

421
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:41.430
Leandro Graterol: I think the same thing, because there is there is not why so.

422
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.900
Susan Snay: Why do you think that it's a female.

423
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:49.320
X.

424
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:11.970
Jessica Zaleski: anyone else agree with me that they think that this is a female.

425
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.490
Leandro Graterol: yeah I think the same thing is because.

426
00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.900
Leandro Graterol: there's no why yes.

427
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.740
Absolutely.

428
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.270
salam: I agree, but I still confused about the why, why is it.

429
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.120
Leandro Graterol: yeah there's no chromosome and I want to know why.

430
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.030
Susan Snay: This content, a little bit confusing think of it as.

431
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:52.110
Susan Snay: The numbers were already there when a scientist made tried to organize these chromosomes so if they found a why they would put it in that place so if this person y chromosome they would have placed it above that why, but when they did they didn't find them.

432
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.910
Susan Snay: So they only found to put them above that spot.

433
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:15.930
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, for how to organize human a human it's like a carrier type template for a human and exactly what Mr they said, as the scientist was organizing the chromosomes okay under a microscope.

434
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.240
Jessica Zaleski: They were moving.

435
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.650
Jessica Zaleski: to align and because there was no why, in this case.

436
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:23.580
Susan Snay: They couldn't.

437
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:26.550
Jessica Zaleski: couldn't put the y chromosome about.

438
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.650
Jessica Zaleski: If there had been one X.

439
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:44.310
Jessica Zaleski: And one why it would have been male like you guys are talking about, but because there are two axes they put them both over X and we know it's a female offspring now let's go back to a minute for some some people we're talking about.

440
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:55.980
Number 2121 21.

441
00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:58.950
salam: I guess so.

442
00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.460
salam: I guess like if he has like.

443
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.250
salam: might be different about it.

444
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:22.890
Susan Snay: So what did what we noticed about chromosomes when do they usually come in today like how many do you usually get.

445
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:27.660
Susan Snay: Each one so.

446
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:29.550
Susan Snay: Okay.

447
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.400
Susan Snay: So if you have three, where do you think what do you think happened what.

448
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.970
Reggie: You couldn't be teaching you something.

449
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.870
Reggie: Really, you mean like what is.

450
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.450
Susan Snay: Jason, can you tell me what you think it is.

451
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.640
Reggie: I try to explain it.

452
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.170
Susan Snay: teenage mutant ninja turtles and the X men.

453
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:19.980
Leandro Graterol: Say that I can you.

454
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.470
Susan Snay: hear me.

455
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.740
Leandro Graterol: Like your MIC is a little loud.

456
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.700
Jessica Zaleski: At least something going on with your bag.

457
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:35.820
Jessica Zaleski: We can hear you, but I think.

458
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.770
Jessica Zaleski: we're getting a lot of background, when you.

459
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.660
Jessica Zaleski: were able to hear other people.

460
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.890
it's hard to hear other people.

461
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:46.020
Susan Snay: Once again.

462
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:53.520
that's.

463
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.470
Reggie: The case.

464
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:56.340
know.

465
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:57.780
Reggie: What.

466
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.980
Leandro Graterol: I think isn't that a such hanging in there in in the DNA.

467
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:26.850
Reggie: Okay, so Okay, when you make a list suppose, so now we all know, the need divided stuff to go into, like the other children or whatever, so I think when a mutation is like maybe a mistake when windows I copying, where you got me into the kid so that's probably will happen.

468
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:42.900
Jessica Zaleski: Okay alright so some type of mistake when it was copying all right, this is good let's think keep hold on to that thought i'm gonna jump back ahead to where we were in our presentation here.

469
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.890
Jessica Zaleski: I gotta go to.

470
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.280
Jessica Zaleski: Import here okay.

471
00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.650
i'm sorry.

472
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.610
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, here we are so um.

473
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:12.330
Jessica Zaleski: When we first made the baby we we did we move those chromosomes and Salaam talked about how she copied them and you guys just shared that.

474
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:24.900
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, it's important that the parent and the offspring, have the same number of chromosomes so that they're the same organism right, because if.

475
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:44.790
Jessica Zaleski: You know, a an offspring is produced that has a different number of chromosomes something's going to be wrong okay it's not and we just saw stereotype of a human a human stereotype where there was one too many chromosomes instead of 46 chromosomes.

476
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.490
Jessica Zaleski: Seven chromosomes.

477
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.360
Jessica Zaleski: let's talk about for a minute, though.

478
00:55:51.360 --> 00:56:01.530
Jessica Zaleski: Like how do those chromosomes actually get from a parent to a baby you guys had a lot of ideas like we talked about through the blood.

479
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:21.000
Jessica Zaleski: Through the umbilical cord, those were all ideas that were in our model, but what actually carries the chromosomes from the parent to the baby take them in it and write your ideas, how do they get from the parent.

480
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:29.820
Jessica Zaleski: We know that chromosomes are inside of a nucleus right inside of a cell.

481
00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:45.660
Jessica Zaleski: But what are what are, I mean we have lots of cells right lots of cells in our body, so how How does that actually get to a baby from a parent to a baby.

482
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.720
Jessica Zaleski: will give you a minute to think about that.

483
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:54.840
Susan Snay: Now you're not you're not referring to the process itself.

484
00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:56.550
Susan Snay: Like.

485
00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:59.130
Jessica Zaleski: How does it travel like what what is.

486
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.160
Jessica Zaleski: I mean we know what's in South.

487
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:04.230
Susan Snay: Yes.

488
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.250
Leandro Graterol: asked you how the Manchester the common sense to debate here.

489
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:18.930
Jessica Zaleski: Well i'm asking like what it, what is it called that the man, you know, like what is that called.

490
00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:37.470
Jessica Zaleski: All my secrets about how the man get the dad gives something and the mom gives something, and that that you know that's how that information gets but what does, what do they give okay let's talk about that does anybody have any ideas like what is it that the mom.

491
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.780
Jessica Zaleski: yeah what is it that the dad gives.

492
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:40.830
Nhi Huynh: I think.

493
00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:42.810
Nhi Huynh: The dad give phone sperm.

494
00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:50.760
Sarah Michaels: me, are you talking yeah go ahead, I just I wanted to make sure other people get a chance okay yeah go ahead.

495
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:58.650
Nhi Huynh: I think the the dad gave his firm and the mother gives an act to form the baby.

496
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.340
Leandro Graterol: that's right yeah I was thinking to.

497
00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.690
Jessica Zaleski: Some of you guys at the beginning, address when we first started.

498
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:08.400
Jessica Zaleski: developing our model.

499
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.320
Jessica Zaleski: You use some of this.

500
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.710
Jessica Zaleski: vocab that that the mom has an egg.

501
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:14.490
Jessica Zaleski: And at.

502
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:18.780
Jessica Zaleski: First it was like well the dad has something kind of like an egg.

503
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:20.700
Susan Snay: i'm going to.

504
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:27.450
Jessica Zaleski: Talk about now, what do we know what do you know about eggs and sperm what are they.

505
00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:33.360
Reggie: Wait okay Okay, I think I got some remember how old miss snake up the fish.

506
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.000
Reggie: eggs right.

507
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.440
Reggie: yeah he got like the.

508
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.660
Reggie: Male fish and then note.

509
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.560
Reggie: That once that just.

510
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.320
Reggie: Like well how do I explain.

511
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.250
Reggie: fertilized eggs.

512
00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:48.540
Reggie: Basically, so, is it like that.

513
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.480
Jessica Zaleski: wow great connection.

514
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.010
Jessica Zaleski: What are those eggs.

515
00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:01.710
Susan Snay: There, a type.

516
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:02.970
of something.

517
00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:05.490
Jessica Zaleski: Anybody now.

518
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.170
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, I was just trying to get to that.

519
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:23.610
salam: Right.

520
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.920
Jessica Zaleski: Well Mister Mister you just said something really important did anybody hear what she said.

521
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.900
Susan Snay: Fish eggs, with only the female fish.

522
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:04.800
No.

523
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.560
Susan Snay: So what else did I need.

524
01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:15.630
Susan Snay: So what's the difference between the male and the female why they, why are we talking about.

525
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.510
salam: mean miss I don't know i'm confused.

yeah.

527
01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.570
salam: This is you guys ask a question i'm confused.

528
01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:43.230
Jessica Zaleski: Well it's 1257 why don't we take a break right now and then we will take a five minute break and we will clarify some of this when we come back okay everybody stand up.

529
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:44.580
Jessica Zaleski: stretch your body, a little bit.

530
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.230
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe get a drink of water.

531
01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.110
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, and we will be back at one.

532
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.020
Jessica Zaleski: or two okay one or.

533
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:52.380
two.

534
01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.800
Susan Snay: Can you hear me OK now.

535
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.450
Jessica Zaleski: it's still really like scratchy and.

536
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:16.770
Jessica Zaleski: background noise and i'm having a lot of trouble.

537
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.490
Susan Snay: Hearing the.

538
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:18.720
Students when they're talking.

539
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.330
Susan Snay: Okay.

540
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:35.790
Susan Snay: Well, my chromebook like I said it crashed twice, so I think i'm gonna have to wash it, which means everything off of it so yeah I can do that till later today.

541
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.000
Sarah Michaels: What are you on.

542
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.680
Susan Snay: A chromebook chromebooks.

543
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.970
Raquel Fernandes: What is you log in your phone.

544
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.390
Raquel Fernandes: audio in your phone, not the computer.

545
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.630
Raquel Fernandes: In the fall into.

546
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:55.140
That.

547
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.140
Raquel Fernandes: And I think the microphone is really.

548
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:02.460
Raquel Fernandes: Like make.

549
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:06.870
Raquel Fernandes: capturing a lot of information that is making read wow.

550
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:13.650
Susan Snay: And it's weird because I need to turn the fish filter so that it wouldn't be really loud it's just me in this room by myself.

551
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.380
Jessica Zaleski: it's so odd there's like a weird kind of.

552
01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:19.830
Jessica Zaleski: A buzzing sound buzzy.

553
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.980
Susan Snay: Okay, all right, let me know i'll try to log on to my.

554
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:28.770
Anisha Hassan: yeah.

555
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:33.600
Anisha Hassan: I think you just have to do what he's doing and have to talk with one.

556
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.590
Sarah Michaels: That seems to work.

557
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.970
Anisha Hassan: These chromebooks need to be updated.

558
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:49.410
Something is not right.

559
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.010
Jessica Zaleski: Well there's good news on that product.

560
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.130
Sarah Michaels: And thank you so much i'm so proud of you.

561
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.200
Sarah Michaels: She couldn't share her screen first concert computer was charging and she's.

562
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:05.940
Jessica Zaleski: she's fixed she is hi Catherine.

563
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.520
Susan Snay: out the sound on this is this any better.

564
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.480
Jessica Zaleski: Much better.

565
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:22.200
Susan Snay: Better Okay, so I guess, I have to do what angie did so I should have just listened, you know, should have asked her to solve this for me right.

566
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.640
Susan Snay: and

567
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.180
salam: We miss, I have a question.

568
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.280
salam: have to do something with the mind.

569
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.880
salam: doesn't have to do something with the molecules.

570
01:03:52.470 --> 01:04:00.300
Susan Snay: What I think the question we were asking when we first left was what are the egg and sperm what kinds of cells, they are.

571
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.230
Jessica Zaleski: Right, I was even.

572
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.250
Jessica Zaleski: A step back from that.

573
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.860
Reggie: aren't the REP so Those were my.

574
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.330
Reggie: Okay.

575
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.720
Jessica Zaleski: I don't think we're all at the point where we're understanding that there.

576
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.310
Susan Snay: So I don't think so.

577
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:12.810
salam: yeah I miss.

578
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.260
Reggie: The cells are confused so they're not supposed to.

579
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.520
Reggie: Be.

580
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:19.530

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.200
Jessica Zaleski: yeah it is.

582
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.010
uh huh.

583
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.420
salam: that's, then this is what type, it is I don't know.

584
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.390
Jessica Zaleski: we're gonna I think it's time for clarification on.

585
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.470
Susan Snay: yeah yeah.

586
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.800
Susan Snay: yeah not every not every cell is an exile.

587
01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.090
Jessica Zaleski: Nothing no.

588
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:45.450
Susan Snay: we're just gonna wait till everybody gets back that way there, we can all be part of the conversation.

589
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:30.420
Susan Snay: Just let me know if the sound of the filter gets too loud.

590
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.860
Susan Snay: I just don't know what the hell my phone picks up compared to the computer.

591
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:36.990
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, are we pretty much back here it's 10104 so all right, so if everyone can just turn their cameras on, so we can check in and make sure everyone's here thanks hi Sabina hi salama angie reggie key shun Uli Nora.

592
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.010
Susan Snay: Can you see, I had to do the same thing you did.

593
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.480
Susan Snay: I had to actually log in with my phone too thanks for the idea.

594
01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:56.490
Leandro Graterol: So I mean right now I can turn on my camera, can I just we just five minutes.

595
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.480
Jessica Zaleski: it's okay if you're eating that we won't even mind.

596
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:06.000
Jessica Zaleski: i've got a few like.

597
01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.530
Susan Snay: Good how often were just some.

598
01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.390
Jessica Zaleski: berries and raspberries here.

599
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:12.930
Sarah Michaels: Yes, totally okay alien.

600
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:14.340
Jessica Zaleski: yeah i'm.

601
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:22.530
Jessica Zaleski: Sorry, so we were having a little bit of a discussion and almost debate about what are these things.

602
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:24.570
Jessica Zaleski: i'm gonna, let me just.

603
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.470
Jessica Zaleski: Share again i'm not again i'm not as used to using.

604
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:40.380
Susan Snay: So we I think we kind of narrowed it down to an egg and sperm you recognize that there's an egg and sperm, and we were trying to figure out what what they were what what type of cells are these.

605
01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.590
Jessica Zaleski: So let's start with.

606
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:55.050
Jessica Zaleski: clarifying some important information here right so when we had the dad and the mom.

607
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.990
Jessica Zaleski: In the Green and yellow circles.

608
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:21.330
Jessica Zaleski: We knew like that wasn't the actual data mom that was like some part of the dad and mom that we're giving that information to the baby and now we've kind of turned talked about okay well the part from the mom is an egg and, apart from a dad is a sperm.

609
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:30.690
Jessica Zaleski: Now we know that those chromosomes are inside a nucleus, and what is the nucleus inside.

610
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:51.090
Jessica Zaleski: A cell Okay, so that means that a sperm is a special type of style, but only the male species produces and the well in I shouldn't say that right misnamed because.

611
01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:51.840
Jessica Zaleski: My answers as.

612
01:09:52.050 --> 01:09:54.990
Susan Snay: Well, right in plants we don't call the male self.

613
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.770
Jessica Zaleski: sperm yeah.

614
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:56.970
Susan Snay: We call it pollen.

615
01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:09.390
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and in a female an egg is a special type of cell that is produced by the female of the species.

616
01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:15.900
Jessica Zaleski: But they are cells and reggie said right before we left what type of cells are they reggie.

617
01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:19.590
Reggie: ready to buy the reproductive cells of the.

618
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:22.530
Jessica Zaleski: reproductive cells.

619
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:31.320
Susan Snay: which makes sense because organisms are using those cells in order to reproduce more of that species.

620
01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:53.910
Susan Snay: Now you can actually see in red on this slide that there's a specialized term that we use in science to represent all types of reproductive cells, whether they're male or female they're called gametes see that word at the bottom gametes aka means, otherwise known as okay.

621
01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:55.500
Susan Snay: He showed me.

622
01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:59.520
Sarah Michaels: The chat so good on yuki Sean.

623
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.320
Susan Snay: yep awesome.

624
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:11.880
Jessica Zaleski: So, eggs and sperm are gametes so let's go back to our model for a minute and see if there's anything we want to add or clarify.

625
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:27.630
Jessica Zaleski: So if we start at the top one set of chromosomes determines if the offspring is male or female, we added that yesterday, right, we know that if it's an XX it's a female if an X, Y it's a male.

626
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:40.350
Jessica Zaleski: We also agreed that the offspring, will have the same number of chromosomes as the parent and you talked about that again today, like if it's a three pair three.

627
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:57.510
Jessica Zaleski: Set pairs of chromosomes mosquito it's the baby has got to have three pairs of chromosomes now there is an egg from the mother and there is a sperm, which is something like the egg from the father, can we like think about.

628
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:00.090
Jessica Zaleski: Like what.

629
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:10.140
Jessica Zaleski: Do we want to change anything, remember that the question here is how does the information get from the parents to the offspring.

630
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:12.720
Jessica Zaleski: So.

631
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.290
Susan Snay: What if an organism doesn't have a sperm cell.

632
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:24.330
Susan Snay: like this does every does does every species have a sperm cell.

633
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:41.340
Susan Snay: Can everybody see that Okay, I know there's a lot of small words on there.

634
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.780
Reggie: yeah again okay.

635
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.800
Susan Snay: So number three says there is an egg from the mother.

636
01:12:48.330 --> 01:13:03.360
Susan Snay: And for there was a sperm or something like an egg from the father so we've already determined that the sperm, is what we said was from the father, so he could probably get rid of part of that right yep what part can we get rid of who can come to see what to get rid of.

637
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.040
Reggie: Something like a.

638
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.480
Susan Snay: dolphin like an egg right.

639
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:24.870
Jessica Zaleski: But I think what missy missy is asking is like if we're talking, I mean I know we tend to think in terms of animals right we're thinking about humans and we're thinking about mosquitoes and dog and but, but what about if it's a plant do we say that plants have eggs and sperm.

640
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.510
Reggie: Do you.

641
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:32.250
Jessica Zaleski: know so what's that special word to describe.

642
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:32.490
No.

643
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:34.860
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

644
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.400
Paul.

645
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:37.740
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so i'm plants it's.

646
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:38.430
pollen.

647
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:45.480
Susan Snay: What if we wanted to use one word to describe all of those cells.

648
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:50.610
Susan Snay: Maybe a new word that you just learned.

649
01:13:52.020 --> 01:14:05.520
Jessica Zaleski: We can use it to describe sperm and egg but it's also just kind of a broader term to describe those special cells that allow organisms to reproduce.

650
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.610
Jessica Zaleski: Can you hear me.

651
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:31.860
Jessica Zaleski: OK so again we're trying to talk about this this as a process that applies not just to humans, because it isn't How does her reputable information get from human parents to offspring it's from any parents to offspring of any organism that produces up reproduces in this way, so.

652
01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:41.640
Jessica Zaleski: How do the parents pass that information through what What are those things, called.

653
01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:44.010
salam: shimmy.

654
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:47.160
Jessica Zaleski: gametes okay.

655
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:51.510
Jessica Zaleski: So parents.

656
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.290
Jessica Zaleski: How do we want to say this.

657
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:57.180
Susan Snay: yeah who can actually say that.

658
01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:05.790
Susan Snay: say a statement saying something about the gametes and parents, so this is he can actually type it in tell her what to type.

659
01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:08.910
salam: Parents pass game these.

660
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.590
salam: chromosomes.

661
01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:30.420
Jessica Zaleski: Well, what is the process called that through which the parents are giving these gametes and making more of making offspring what is that called.

662
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:32.520
Nhi Huynh: fertilization.

663
01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:35.910
Jessica Zaleski: we're talking.

664
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.790
Jessica Zaleski: About there's a little shy hmm.

665
01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.610
Jessica Zaleski: back up a step yeah.

666
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:42.570
Susan Snay: before that.

667
01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.410
Jessica Zaleski: before that.

668
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:49.440
Jessica Zaleski: So if, like a plant and another plant they make gametes.

669
01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:55.230
Jessica Zaleski: And then they're going to make more of themselves, what do we call it when they're making more of themselves.

670
01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.340
Reggie: You productive.

671
01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.200
yeah.

672
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.930
Jessica Zaleski: So parents.

673
01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.210
Susan Snay: Have gametes.

674
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:12.930
Jessica Zaleski: Now, are the parents passing the gametes, what are the parents doing with the gametes.

675
01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:17.010
salam: talking to the baby.

676
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:18.270
Leandro Graterol: The baby yeah.

677
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:22.740
Susan Snay: So the mom and the dad just hand them to the baby.

678
01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:24.630
Susan Snay: A book.

679
01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.190
salam: there's like a process.

680
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.290
Sarah Michaels: just keep going back to the what reggie was saying about.

681
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:52.590
The.

682
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:55.770
Jessica Zaleski: EU angie said through DNA.

683
01:16:56.970 --> 01:17:00.480
Jessica Zaleski: So the DNA where's the DNA angie where is that DNA.

684
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.300
Jessica Zaleski: Think about the video we watched angie.

685
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.410
salam: Before good.

686
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.620
Reggie: yeah it's in the nucleus.

687
01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:17.010
Jessica Zaleski: Do you agree with that angie that it's in the nucleus Okay, I can see you nodding your head i'm looking at.

688
01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:22.980
Jessica Zaleski: awesome so alright, so do angie agrees that the DNA is in the nucleus.

689
01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:32.310
Jessica Zaleski: The nucleus is inside a cell in this case we're talking about a special type of cell.

690
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:44.280
Jessica Zaleski: special types of cells that come from an organism we call them gametes they're not like other cells they're not like skin cells or.

691
01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:46.680
Susan Snay: muscle cells or.

692
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:53.160
Jessica Zaleski: muscle cells or nerve cells or i'm trying to think in a plant like you know they're not like.

693
01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.380
Jessica Zaleski: they're different they're different than that they're special okay and.

694
01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.770
Jessica Zaleski: How did those cells.

695
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.950
Jessica Zaleski: What do those cells do.

696
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:18.540
Reggie: Right over the sun's already knows that the cells are going to be passed on to the offspring.

697
01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:24.150
Susan Snay: Okay, look at look what Mrs he started to type that might be a hint.

698
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:33.780
Susan Snay: So what did those specialized gametes or egg and sperm or pollen what do they do.

699
01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:35.040
Do.

700
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:39.090
Reggie: They hope with the reproductive like.

701
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.370
Reggie: confused at once.

702
01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.600
Susan Snay: So, can you read read you can you read what Mrs he just typed in number three.

703
01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.070
Reggie: is passed down game use for reproduction.

704
01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:01.200
Susan Snay: So this.

705
01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:09.330
Jessica Zaleski: This is the word that I think we need to talk about here pass the past and reggie just set it as passed down, which is, I think, is probably what.

706
01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:21.240
Jessica Zaleski: Some of you might be thinking and i'm I pass like okay we'll use i'm a mom Okay, I have three children, did I just pass my egg to my children.

707
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.920
Leandro Graterol: yeah.

708
01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:23.700
Now.

709
01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:29.670
Jessica Zaleski: What happened inside my body, where did the idea come from.

710
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.890
Jessica Zaleski: fertilization from the dad.

711
01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:43.590
Leandro Graterol: like this well yeah like the dad is raspberry this Brian to them and then mcquaid egg.

712
01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:45.510
Jessica Zaleski: Well, wait a minute whoa.

713
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:46.770
Jessica Zaleski: that's awfully and.

714
01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.260
Jessica Zaleski: What is the mom do.

715
01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.760
Leandro Graterol: Great the.

716
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.500
Jessica Zaleski: creator.

717
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.540
Susan Snay: Oh.

718
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:57.180
Jessica Zaleski: And did the dad create the sperm.

719
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.350
yeah.

720
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.020
Jessica Zaleski: Oh OK.

721
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:02.130
Jessica Zaleski: I were.

722
01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.640
Sarah Michaels: wonder if the word create instead of pass mean.

723
01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:06.810
The parent oh.

724
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:08.520
Sarah Michaels: I don't know.

725
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:12.480
Anisha Hassan: i'm also key Sean just use the word fertilization.

726
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:18.240
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so create GAM okay.

727
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:20.340
Jessica Zaleski: So I like that create because that.

728
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:32.160
Jessica Zaleski: What they're doing is they're creating or they're making these gametes right like the mom is making again if we're talking about humans or other like animals that reproduced.

729
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:32.910
Susan Snay: ish.

730
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.560
Jessica Zaleski: that's it get out the dog.

731
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:54.000
Jessica Zaleski: away, you know they're creating eggs and sperm right for reproduction OK, and then let's talk about that fertilized fertilization so Nikki talked about fertilization key Sean talked about fertilization.

732
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.550
Susan Snay: What a regimen show you show yeah.

733
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.720
Susan Snay: So what yeah, what do you think fertilization is.

734
01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:09.480
Leandro Graterol: Wait what was the question so.

735
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:14.070
Jessica Zaleski: What is fertilization i'm just going to type it in the chat just so people can read it.

736
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:15.900
Jessica Zaleski: They want to see the question written.

737
01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.600
Jessica Zaleski: anybody think they have an idea of what that is.

738
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.400
salam: Like making production.

739
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:38.220
Jessica Zaleski: it's got something to do with reproduction yeah.

740
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.350
Leandro Graterol: I think I remember something like that, but i'm trying to remember.

741
01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.130
Susan Snay: What do you think you might need for fertilization.

742
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.890
salam: Someone to make it.

743
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:05.160
Reggie: A given us room.

744
01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:08.940
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so those gametes.

745
01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:13.740
Jessica Zaleski: So what it What are those gametes do.

746
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:20.070
Jessica Zaleski: How, what does that have to do with fertilization what happens for fertilization to happen.

747
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:22.860
salam: To them.

748
01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:29.370
Jessica Zaleski: i'm seeing Sabina I can't hear you Sabrina can you try again we just trying to talk.

749
01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:33.600
Leandro Graterol: So maybe.

750
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:34.560
Leandro Graterol: So you.

751
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:36.720
Leandro Graterol: ready for your station right.

752
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:50.160
Jessica Zaleski: Sorry, one moment Leandro Sabina I can't hear you can use Sabina can you type it in the chat because we are unable to hear you so i'm going to watch for Sabina to type in the chat leandra go ahead.

753
01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.920
Jessica Zaleski: Did you want to share something.

754
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:07.920
Jessica Zaleski: I can't hear you Leandro.

755
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:18.360
Sarah Michaels: You know what I keep thinking about but i'm not at all clear on what what how this would happen, I remember that when we made the baby.

756
01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.660
Sarah Michaels: it's like they each had pairs but the baby only got one.

757
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:29.010
Sarah Michaels: So i'm wondering what's what's the gamma look like.

758
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:31.620
salam: Is it like a process of combining.

759
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:33.000
With.

760
01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:44.730
Susan Snay: Can you say that one more time so i'm not quite sure what I understand what you meant by that question Where are you confused about that.

761
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:46.050
salam: Just isn't.

762
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:49.650
Sarah Michaels: That an idea go ahead.

763
01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.670
Susan Snay: Okay, go ahead Salaam.

764
01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.320
salam: I said I said isn't it like the process of combining the again.

765
01:23:58.290 --> 01:23:59.640
Susan Snay: Is what the process.

766
01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.540
salam: Like combining that I can.

767
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.020
Jessica Zaleski: Put Sabina just wrote in the chat So if you.

768
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:12.780
Jessica Zaleski: wrote the process of combining the mail gimme or sperm with the female Gani.

769
01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:15.870
Susan Snay: Oh, is that answering what is fertilization.

770
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.950
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, that's what have you.

771
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.600
Jessica Zaleski: So why.

772
01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:30.090
Reggie: wouldn't it be like a paper towel like if you had a paper towel when you have like water he likes political droplet of water and he would tell the parents are like sorry bit musically just like that.

773
01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.670
Jessica Zaleski: That is interesting, we don't.

774
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:35.550
Jessica Zaleski: know we haven't talked about like how those things.

775
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:54.240
Jessica Zaleski: Combined Okay, but let's take what's the veena was saying um and try to add it so parents create gametes for reproduction and then, what do those gametes do according to what Sabina just said, the gametes what.

776
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.170
salam: i'm buying.

777
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:56.730
Jessica Zaleski: Come back combine.

778
01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.420
salam: Combine on that.

779
01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:02.970
salam: mom and dad shame yeah.

780
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:06.090
Jessica Zaleski: So the gametes combined to make what.

781
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:09.240
salam: Make baby.

782
01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:10.350
Leandro Graterol: Baby yeah.

783
01:25:10.410 --> 01:25:11.250
Jessica Zaleski: yeah to me.

784
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.600
Jessica Zaleski: Well let's use.

785
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.510
Susan Snay: The baby yeah what she's off because we don't call.

786
01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.910
Susan Snay: them mosquitoes babies we call them offspring.

787
01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.130
Keyshawn: So if we use.

788
01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.340
Susan Snay: If we use that word offspring, we can talk about any species.

789
01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:24.510
and make the same.

790
01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:36.630
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so I want everybody to take a look at number six now you guys have just said that the way the information.

791
01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:58.590
Jessica Zaleski: That we know that the information the genetic information is in those on those chromosomes inside the nucleus inside the cells and that the south, the special cells that sperm and egg cells are gametes are combined to make the offspring so.

792
01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:12.960
Jessica Zaleski: Does the genetic information go through blood or the umbilical cord to get to the baby How does that genetic information get from the parents to the baby.

793
01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:14.100
blog.

794
01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.780
salam: For this one day.

795
01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.210
salam: yeah I guess.

796
01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:31.350
Susan Snay: So does the does the dad have an umbilical cord, to make the sperm.

797
01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:38.610
salam: yeah.

798
01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:39.810
Nhi Huynh: Through the blood.

799
01:26:45.210 --> 01:26:49.560
Susan Snay: I thought I thought we talked about number six last class but i'm not sure.

800
01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.850
Jessica Zaleski: Well, I think we need to keep.

801
01:26:50.850 --> 01:26:51.780
Susan Snay: Talking about.

802
01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.280
Jessica Zaleski: It because yeah so let's I want everybody to look at number three.

803
01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:02.820
Jessica Zaleski: And number four and let's really talk about like what are gametes again.

804
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:07.230
Jessica Zaleski: gametes are types of what.

805
01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:21.930
Jessica Zaleski: jojo what sells right gametes are type of types of cells, they could be in animals sperm cell or exile in plants like misty said paulin.

806
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:31.170
Susan Snay: How many of you are allergic to pollen you have allergies in the spring, with the pollen from the trees are the grass make you sneeze make sure knows stuffy.

807
01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:40.500
Susan Snay: pollen is the mail Danny for trees and grasses and flowers.

808
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:59.820
Jessica Zaleski: So you guys agree that gametes ourselves their special cells inside every cell has a nucleus with genetic information inside with the DNA and those chromosomes inside so.

809
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:10.050
Jessica Zaleski: We said that the gametes combine to make offspring that's what number four says so, if those Gani are combining.

810
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:21.420
Jessica Zaleski: And joining those cells are joining, how is that getting past that information getting past.

811
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:27.180
Sarah Michaels: Okay Sean said, the process of the sperm combining with the egg.

812
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.400
Okay.

813
01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.560
Susan Snay: So so.

814
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:39.810
Sarah Michaels: If each game, it is a cell does the new cell that combat is this thing that combines them also a cell.

815
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.990
Leandro Graterol: Well, what was the question.

816
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:45.570
Sarah Michaels: If the gametes.

817
01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:46.680
If we.

818
01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.800
Sarah Michaels: Get Gambia in the female gametes ourselves.

819
01:28:53.910 --> 01:29:00.720
Sarah Michaels: Then, when when there's some process of them, combining does that make a cell or.

820
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:09.840
Sarah Michaels: there's no blood we're not talking about blood or umbilical cord, so what happens when they combine instead of cell, but they make.

821
01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:11.760
Sarah Michaels: A bigger so.

822
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:19.500
Susan Snay: Can the organism only can the organism be viable, with only half of the chromosomes.

823
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.510
Susan Snay: So we talked about humans having 46.

824
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:33.540
Susan Snay: or 23 pairs could a human be liable, with only 23 total chromosomes.

825
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:37.500
Sarah Michaels: Are there only 23 and again meet.

826
01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.110
salam: And, like the whole family.

827
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:45.690
salam: I missed I couldn't hear.

828
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.020
Susan Snay: So if there's.

829
01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.160
Susan Snay: Can a human organism.

830
01:29:54.270 --> 01:30:01.020
Susan Snay: be viable survive with 23 chromosomes only 2323 pairs but only 23.

831
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:01.920
salam: No.

832
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.340
Susan Snay: No, no, so how many do you need to be a human.

833
01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.600
Susan Snay: 4646.

834
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:12.390
salam: So and 23.

835
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:17.760
Susan Snay: Okay So how do we get the 23 pairs what has to happen.

836
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.210
Reggie: You have to combine them.

837
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:22.740
Jessica Zaleski: combined.

838
01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:34.020
Jessica Zaleski: OK so i'm going to get the information those chromosomes from my dad through what.

839
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.950
salam: You have to combine the game me.

840
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:44.250
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so from his grammy and the information from my mom from.

841
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.260
Leandro Graterol: A.

842
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:48.210
salam: hurricane.

843
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.640
Jessica Zaleski: or Danny or egg okay.

844
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:56.250
Jessica Zaleski: Where does the genetic information come from from blood.

845
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:58.170
yeah.

846
01:30:59.220 --> 01:30:59.700
Reggie: No.

847
01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:03.060
Susan Snay: No we've been talking talking about blooded Oh, you would just.

848
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:05.040
salam: Oh so we're.

849
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:07.710
Jessica Zaleski: we're almost complete.

850
01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:16.740
Jessica Zaleski: key challenges and chromosomes yeah yeah so so this important that we're not talking about blood at all.

851
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:21.210
Susan Snay: that's a totally different kind of cell blood cells are different cells.

852
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:28.800
Susan Snay: Right I can't take blood cells and produce offspring from them and I.

853
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.500
Susan Snay: know only under says.

854
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.710
Susan Snay: So these are special cells we're talking about right.

855
01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:46.950
Susan Snay: If we can't just use any old cell to make a new offspring, these are very special specialized cells.

856
01:31:50.400 --> 01:32:09.870
Jessica Zaleski: Okay alright, so we just want to just the information is being passed through the gametes not through the blood through those special cells okay um I think at this point we're going to go and do some practice on.

857
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:13.620
Jessica Zaleski: Making some babies again.

858
01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.090
Susan Snay: Now gametes it looks.

859
01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:15.840
Jessica Zaleski: at me it's.

860
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:33.360
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly Now I want to go over, we want to just talk about how we are going to do this for a minute Okay, so let me share this my screens a little off here, I apologize okay oh look at this, what do you think this is a picture of down here.

861
01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:34.770
salam: Again me.

862
01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.590
Reggie: No, no sperm and egg.

863
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:40.080
Susan Snay: Look at the size difference between them.

864
01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:47.820
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so this remember this egg This is one cell.

865
01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:51.600
Jessica Zaleski: it's a special sell a very special cell.

866
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.110
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, this is an egg sell.

867
01:32:56.310 --> 01:33:00.540
Jessica Zaleski: This is a very special sell it is a sperm cell.

868
01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:11.520
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, and when those cells combine what happens to the genetic information in the egg and the sperm.

869
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.840
salam: i'm going.

870
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.490
Susan Snay: To combine.

871
01:33:17.610 --> 01:33:19.320
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly, so that in.

872
01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:26.610
Jessica Zaleski: Israel and that exile and that's genetic information in that sperm cell combine.

873
01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:40.230
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, to make what will be the offspring, so when we go to practice making our babies in this next activity we're going to use these rules.

874
01:33:42.330 --> 01:33:42.840
Go ahead.

875
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.650
Susan Snay: I think they were talking to somebody else.

876
01:33:49.740 --> 01:34:02.850
Jessica Zaleski: Okay um Okay, so we are going to you're going to we're going to be going into breakout rooms and you you're going to be telling your teacher either Sarah is it three breakout rooms in Asia.

877
01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:04.380
Anisha Hassan: or for its for.

878
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:04.740
Jessica Zaleski: or.

879
01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:06.930
Jessica Zaleski: that's right so it's going to be a nisha.

880
01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:21.660
Jessica Zaleski: Sarah missing or me, and we are going to make some babies, now we have we're going to ask for someone to find if they have it in their house a coin.

881
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:30.270
Jessica Zaleski: Because we are going to use a coin, to help us with this process, so you are going to flip a coin.

882
01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:42.660
Jessica Zaleski: To decide which chromosome is passed from each pair of chromosomes so like we know that the dad had three pairs of chromosomes he had a one a.

883
01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:55.260
Jessica Zaleski: And a one B, how do we know which one gets passed to the sperm okay remember we're passing it to the sperm and then you're going to.

884
01:34:55.860 --> 01:35:01.290
Jessica Zaleski: Make the babies from that information and we'll do this, a couple times and we want to write down.

885
01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:18.630
Jessica Zaleski: Which combinations we get as we go Okay, so these directions are inside the activity, what I am going to do right now is i'm going to stop sharing and if everybody will everybody should have access to this right it's in the virtual science.

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:06.780
Jessica Zaleski: We were going to be late but that's Okay, this is good.

909
01:57:12.690 --> 01:57:21.840
Susan Snay: My computer just decided to act on its own so i'm gonna have to redo our slide a little bit because we've got numbers everywhere it like numbers everywhere so.

910
01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:24.450
Susan Snay: I just want our kids to think that it was that.

911
01:57:26.370 --> 01:57:34.290
Anisha Hassan: um I thought we could copy paste the ones from the bb too, but it wasn't copying and i'm like struggling.

912
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.840
Susan Snay: That.

913
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:39.990
Jessica Zaleski: The mom did not have prime.

914
01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:40.770
Susan Snay: mark right.

915
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:47.910
Jessica Zaleski: Next to her and she should have next to all of hers one of them did, and one of them did not so.

916
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.490
Anisha Hassan: But we I don't see any primary.

917
01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:51.420
Jessica Zaleski: I well.

918
01:57:51.630 --> 01:57:52.770
Susan Snay: I don't have it online either.

919
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:55.200
Jessica Zaleski: yeah I only had three a prime.

920
01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:57.120
Jessica Zaleski: By.

921
01:57:57.330 --> 01:58:10.800
Susan Snay: You know what I shared with our kids with our group, I said that this was this was designed just for this remote learning that in school, we would have been doing this with with pipe cleaners, and moving them around so you know this trial and error, we.

922
01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:21.510
Susan Snay: were trying to make this perfect for the next group that needs to do this, so you guys are being the pioneers to creating this lesson so much for your patience.

923
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:22.290
Susan Snay: So loosely.

924
01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.590
Jessica Zaleski: Is everyone back I don't think so right.

925
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:28.830
Susan Snay: let's see we.

926
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:31.410
Jessica Zaleski: yeah oh everyone's back.

927
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.910
Susan Snay: It looks like it yeah yep.

928
01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:37.350
Jessica Zaleski: awesome okay so i'm just going to share my screen really quickly.

929
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:39.300
Susan Snay: and yours, have the prime on it.

930
01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:42.570
Jessica Zaleski: No, I I was adding them in here.

931
01:58:42.570 --> 01:58:46.590
Susan Snay: Because I will go in and add them back in on ours too yeah.

932
01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:56.430
Jessica Zaleski: that's fine So what we ended up doing was we I actually took a screenshot of our first one, but then i'm Nikki was recording the different combinations.

933
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:57.780
Jessica Zaleski: That okay.

934
01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:58.170
Susan Snay: Oh you're.

935
01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:00.420
Jessica Zaleski: Writing it down, and you know writing it down in your notebook.

936
01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.470
Susan Snay: yeah good idea.

937
01:59:01.710 --> 01:59:08.520
Jessica Zaleski: But let's just talk about because we only have four minutes left, but I think let's just talk about some key takeaways here.

938
01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:17.340
Jessica Zaleski: From this activity um let's see i'm just going to kind of call on people here and see if they can help us out with this so.

939
01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:42.510
Jessica Zaleski: um let's see here i'm just trying to scroll through Edwin, can you tell us when the dad creates sperm the dad has three pair six chromosomes total right in whatever this is if it's a mosquito or whatever he's got six chromosomes total how many chromosomes will be in the sperm.

940
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:51.000
Jessica Zaleski: Read will be in this firm Okay, so if I was just going to like randomly pick I could just.

941
01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:57.180
Jessica Zaleski: randomly pick whatever did you guys do the coin flipping i'm sure.

942
01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:57.870
Susan Snay: We did.

943
01:59:57.990 --> 02:00:06.390
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, there we go so that's firms going to have three okay reggie how many chromosomes are going to be in the egg.

944
02:00:06.450 --> 02:00:06.870
Jessica Zaleski: three.

945
02:00:07.650 --> 02:00:09.750
Jessica Zaleski: Only three okay I.

946
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:11.310
Think there's only three.

947
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:14.760
salam: You have to copy.

948
02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:16.680
Susan Snay: Right.

949
02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:19.800
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, you would have copied it should have copied i'm going to.

950
02:00:20.190 --> 02:00:24.990
Susan Snay: The people of the programs acting funny so that's why we're not copying it all costs.

951
02:00:26.190 --> 02:00:27.150
Jessica Zaleski: So we talked about.

952
02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.800
Susan Snay: Why, there were only three in each one in the egg and the sperm.

953
02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:34.020
salam: Because you combine them together.

954
02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:35.640
Susan Snay: To make how many.

955
02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:36.900
To mixing.

956
02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:39.630
Susan Snay: Oh, oh.

957
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.260
Jessica Zaleski: There we go now I can make now I can copy them.

958
02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.510
Susan Snay: yeah that's why it wouldn't let me do it till then either.

959
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:58.590
Jessica Zaleski: it's alright, so now, because how many the dad and mom each had six how many does the the baby have to have.

960
02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:04.140
Jessica Zaleski: Six so that it's the same organism right.

961
02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.080
Jessica Zaleski: All right, so when we combine these when the sperm and egg combine.

962
02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:13.740
Jessica Zaleski: We got our ones together.

963
02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.830
Jessica Zaleski: we've got our tools together.

964
02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.130
Susan Snay: And our threes which will make what whoo.

965
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:26.130
Susan Snay: Oh hi you know that.

966
02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:36.690
Reggie: Because they're the same high which homework first day both X is so much music, at the same height so it's gonna be we're gonna female, but he got smaller line which will be a why will be what's called a male.

967
02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:40.080
Susan Snay: thing we our group ended up with a male.

968
02:01:41.010 --> 02:01:47.070
Sarah Michaels: We did two babies randomly with a coin toss and we got two girls.

969
02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:51.780
Susan Snay: Are we didn't have a chance to go through to because my computer was acting weird yeah.

970
02:01:52.170 --> 02:01:54.240
Anisha Hassan: We got four babies.

971
02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:56.430
Jessica Zaleski: And we ended up with a boy three times.

972
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.800
Susan Snay: wow.

973
02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:03.390
Sarah Michaels: Oh, we were like hoping that our next a boy, and then we ran out.

974
02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:06.930
Jessica Zaleski: Now we're celebrating when we finally got to a girl, like the third.

975
02:02:08.850 --> 02:02:09.090
Jessica Zaleski: But.

976
02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:17.820
Jessica Zaleski: This just shows how we talked about how there were only three pairs of chromosomes in here how many pairs of chromosomes.

977
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:18.630
Jessica Zaleski: In a human.

978
02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:21.930
Jessica Zaleski: Oh 2323.

979
02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.960
Susan Snay: Can you imagine flipping the coin 23 times, all of the different possibilities.

980
02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:30.510
Sarah Michaels: wow.

981
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:31.320
Jessica Zaleski: Lots of.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.200
Sarah Michaels: By Edwin a.

997
02:03:23.670 --> 02:03:24.810
Jessica Zaleski: spike when.

998
02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:33.960
Anisha Hassan: I was struggling with Nora because I had Nora.

999
02:03:35.130 --> 02:03:48.030
Anisha Hassan: reggie and me and me and reggie really into it and really participating but Nora would in turn our camera, the only time she said something was when reggie was showing me his anime drawings.

1000
02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:55.530
Anisha Hassan: read you taking the opportunity to show anyway stuck like cool.

1001
02:03:56.340 --> 02:04:03.330
Sarah Michaels: You have any sense of whether she was kind of following she was with it, just like us to talk, or you couldn't tell.

1002
02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:13.170
Anisha Hassan: I couldn't tell um she I asked her to turn on your camera and she said that she had like family members behind her so she couldn't turn on her camera.

1003
02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.710
Raquel Fernandes: Maybe you can teach her the background.

1004
02:04:17.370 --> 02:04:18.450
Susan Snay: We could try think we.

1005
02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.860
Susan Snay: need to try yeah.

1006
02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:33.120
Susan Snay: i'm usually same thing in our group, our newly never said anything never posted in the chat but I, it could have been i'm I was trying to look at my phone, at the same time, because i'm on both and I just couldn't really keep track of.

1007
02:04:33.690 --> 02:04:44.760
Susan Snay: of both so i'm going to power wash my chromebook today, which means I wipe everything clean off of it and then try to reload it for next time and see if it makes a difference.

1008
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:48.300
Sarah Michaels: um so our group was was.

1009
02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:49.800
Really fortunate.

1010
02:04:51.420 --> 02:05:08.970
Sarah Michaels: Edwin and angie were completely willing to you know chime in and caitlin was completely responsive whenever raquel would TRAN so we read the rules we took turns and she would always translate.

1011
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:17.100
Sarah Michaels: And so, she net she didn't ever camera on, but I think she told me in a private message that.

1012
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:30.450
Sarah Michaels: She she couldn't turn your camera on this week, because it was charging and she promised it would be on next week so anyway, but she was completely you know she was picking which one, and she was in the.

1013
02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:32.070
So she.

1014
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:53.640
Raquel Fernandes: messaged me in throughout the class and I really think she's having a hard time understanding, a lot of the content so like when we were talking about gametes she wasn't understanding what was involving plans and she wasn't she asked me a lot about if it was about photosynthesis.

1015
02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:55.080
Susan Snay: So that's.

1016
02:05:55.140 --> 02:06:10.440
Raquel Fernandes: completely different from what we're seeing right now and I try to write to like translate a lot of always happy in that moment to her, but i'm not sure if she is following, especially when we use difficult words.

1017
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:13.530
Jessica Zaleski: Thank you so much for doing the heck out because.

1018
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:25.590
Jessica Zaleski: I have, I was really worried today with Salaam because Salaam keeps kind of enforcing some.

1019
02:06:26.130 --> 02:06:27.690
Jessica Zaleski: I mean I just.

1020
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:30.180
Susan Snay: I slipped out in left field.

1021
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:33.930
Jessica Zaleski: Like she is out in left field, but just keeps.

1022
02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:41.400
Jessica Zaleski: yeah she's the most vocal she's the most participatory and she's the most confident, so people are just.

1023
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:56.760
Jessica Zaleski: But I still don't know like this is why, when it when it came down to i'm like we just need to explain this we can't let them walk away like the blood has to be off the model list here we can lingering idea because.

1024
02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:11.100
Jessica Zaleski: You know, and I kept in my small group I kept saying like Okay, so a sperm remember this is this cell it's a special type of cell like I i'm still not 100% sure that they all get.

1025
02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.070
Jessica Zaleski: The sperm and egg are a cell.

1026
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:24.960
Jessica Zaleski: Right and that like again, no matter how many times we have watched that video that the chromosomes are in the nucleus, and the nucleus is inside the cell yeah.

1027
02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:36.660
Sarah Michaels: let's go massive hard to imagine you know when you think about it it's just it's, it is hard to get your mind around it could be so tiny.

1028
02:07:37.590 --> 02:07:47.340
Susan Snay: that's why I was hoping the you know the fish eggs would because that's big enough, you can they could actually see those eggs coming out of the goldfish and they could see I mean they can't see.

1029
02:07:47.730 --> 02:07:53.880
Susan Snay: The sperm cell, but they could see the sperm because they can see that Milky substance coming out.

1030
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:55.320
Do.

1031
02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:59.220
Anisha Hassan: Fish reproduce on the outside of the body.

1032
02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:03.300
Susan Snay: yeah the fertilization takes place completely outside.

1033
02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:04.770
Anisha Hassan: Okay, so.

1034
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:17.730
Susan Snay: that's why that's why the mail gold fishes following her her dropping the eggs, that are not fertilized, but the main is going right behind her cloaking her to release eggs, but releasing sperm as the eggs fall.

1035
02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:20.100
Susan Snay: into the water not yeah.

1036
02:08:20.130 --> 02:08:23.640
Susan Snay: it's totally external but I mean plants are too, you know.

1037
02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:24.270
yeah.

1038
02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:34.350
Anisha Hassan: yeah reggie was actually like such an interesting thing he was like wouldn't it be so cool if we could just you know flip a coin and know if it's a girl or a boy.

1039
02:08:34.890 --> 02:08:35.310
yeah.

1040
02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:39.840
Susan Snay: yeah it isn't always that easy.

1041
02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:41.940
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1042
02:08:42.330 --> 02:08:56.970
Jessica Zaleski: I think I was struggling today because the in these aware i'm reminded with amber that I just feel like there is an assumption of a level of background knowledge that our kids just do not have.

1043
02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:00.000
Jessica Zaleski: You know I mean really like.

1044
02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:13.590
Jessica Zaleski: Because they're not taking a lot of time to wrestle through that a sperm and an egg ourselves like and look at what we had to go through to get our kids there, I mean we just.

1045
02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:27.120
Jessica Zaleski: i'm looking at the slide and it says, eggs and sperm male and female gametes Okay, and the assumption is that kids just get that their cells are you say that their cells and they make all those yeah.

1046
02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:29.670
Jessica Zaleski: And this is where again it's like.

1047
02:09:30.150 --> 02:09:40.920
Jessica Zaleski: Because the curriculum is not implying that we should Russell through this, these are times I feel like we just need to teach this and clear it up.

1048
02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:42.150
Jessica Zaleski: You know.

1049
02:09:42.630 --> 02:09:47.010
Sarah Michaels: I felt like today, the wrestling part it seemed kind of.

1050
02:09:48.300 --> 02:10:02.250
Sarah Michaels: It kind of it, they kind of got something and then, when we teach when we teach it and reinforce it like I feel like actually making the sperm and making the egg.

1051
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:07.950
Sarah Michaels: At least there's a foundation for talking about halfway down the Ross.

1052
02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:08.670
Susan Snay: yeah that's another.

1053
02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:15.450
Jessica Zaleski: Time that's the next slide so that that activity that activity was critical.

1054
02:10:15.570 --> 02:10:16.320
Susan Snay: Oh yes.

1055
02:10:16.410 --> 02:10:23.880
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely, the idea that Okay, and I, because I said when we went in there, like we went through all the slides, and I said okay remember like.

1056
02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:29.220
Jessica Zaleski: This the dad just give the chromosomes to the baby know how does that happen like.

1057
02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:38.850
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, the sperm Okay, so what is what is going into the sperm, you know, and one of them said Oh, only three and I said well why only three.

1058
02:10:39.090 --> 02:10:44.550
Jessica Zaleski: Lisa because if the mom and the dad each give three that'll be six total and it needs to have six.

1059
02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:56.730
Jessica Zaleski: So, like they have a friend knowledge at that point to get there, what i'm always concerned about and I think stu and I see this all the time and it's extra to extra true in remote learning.

1060
02:10:57.270 --> 02:11:10.620
Jessica Zaleski: is like they just miss these critical things you know, and then there are like these major gaps and we've been seeing it with Salaam all year long, even when you were doing body systems.

1061
02:11:10.770 --> 02:11:20.010
Susan Snay: I think, well, a lot of that as culture, because you gotta remember certain cultures won't teach any thing about reproduction.

1062
02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:24.120
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah but I need to think about when we were doing the body systems and she has this.

1063
02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:34.050
Jessica Zaleski: Like something really out of left field very confidently that showed she had not grasped what we had taught before.

1064
02:11:34.230 --> 02:11:37.980
Susan Snay: Right or or had complete misconceptions about.

1065
02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:50.400
Jessica Zaleski: fashion, about what we talked about um you know, like she would say that the heart is in the digestive system after we had talked about the digestive like basic things like that.

1066
02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.950
Susan Snay: There might be something else going on.

1067
02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:55.470
Susan Snay: inside one now that the more I think about.

1068
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:57.900
Jessica Zaleski: It she's not the only one that has some of these.

1069
02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:59.040
Jessica Zaleski: misconceptions and it's.

1070
02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:03.480
Jessica Zaleski: ready to pick up on them in this format than it is in the classroom.

1071
02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:10.530
Sarah Michaels: yeah I think we should get we should figure out what are some absolutely key ideas like.

1072
02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:22.380
Sarah Michaels: The sperm and the egg are gametes and gametes are really, really special cells, I mean we got that idea out, but I think that needs to be.

1073
02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:30.360
Sarah Michaels: I think we need to start saying Okay, who can put that idea into their own words and they've got to somehow come up and then who else can.

1074
02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:35.670
Sarah Michaels: And, or if somebody says it can you put into your own words, what he just said.

1075
02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:48.450
Sarah Michaels: Because if they've got to be able to somehow articulate so that's one key idea, the gametes are really special cells and two gametes.

1076
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:56.250
Sarah Michaels: come together mean they now have experienced it sort of but now they've got to be able to say it.

1077
02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:01.500
Sarah Michaels: And if they don't completely get it, it should come out in how they can.

1078
02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:12.330
Sarah Michaels: repeat it, and those are the you know the key model ideas that we want to come back you know that and get everyone should be able to say what are the model ideas.

1079
02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:33.630
Sarah Michaels: That we're all going to walk away with now maybe we won't get to it fully tomorrow, but the but that slowness, I think, is worth it, as long as we come back to making sure that everyone owns me I think everyone gets right now that the sperm and the egg are.

1080
02:13:33.810 --> 02:13:39.210
Anisha Hassan: gametes that's the thing I don't I feel like there's just so many terms because.

1081
02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:43.320
Anisha Hassan: You know their cells and their reproductive cells are also gametes.

1082
02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:46.410
Sarah Michaels: And they're also egg and sperm yeah push it our gang.

1083
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:48.330
Susan Snay: names for the same thing.

1084
02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:53.100
Anisha Hassan: Like then somebody said fertilization, and like and that's.

1085
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:54.120
Susan Snay: Like I go.

1086
02:13:54.930 --> 02:13:55.380
Susan Snay: I go.

1087
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:55.860
Jessica Zaleski: I know.

1088
02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.770
Anisha Hassan: yeah I think the baby is, as I God well.

1089
02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:15.870
Jessica Zaleski: Sarah you had asked somebody had asked something about what is that call and like I know this is sometimes true were following this order of presentation is frustrating because they don't introduce I go until after they introduce half Lloyd.

1090
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:16.350
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1091
02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:20.730
Jessica Zaleski: Where is it's like we could have introduced zygote what did they combine to make.

1092
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:21.240
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1093
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:29.370
Jessica Zaleski: You know, like that could have been introduced and again if we were in person, we probably just would have introduced.

1094
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:32.400
Jessica Zaleski: But certainly no easy way to do that here.

1095
02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.580
Sarah Michaels: So the interesting thing is once they get the idea that, when they come together they create something called.

1096
02:14:39.150 --> 02:14:48.630
Sarah Michaels: And we could call it whatever we want to call it the first part of the beginning baby cell or something like that, and we can then whatever or a zygote.

1097
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:58.590
Sarah Michaels: But if they got that that that's a thing, and it has to be somewhere there's no blood there's no um it's it's a thing they actually produce.

1098
02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:17.370
Sarah Michaels: And they have the sperm is real the egg is real, I mean I think they sort of in that picture was so interesting because you see how big the egg is but anyway they're both cells, and I think we need to reinforce that big cell smaller cell but they're both cells, they both have.

1099
02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.080
Sarah Michaels: information.

1100
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:20.970
Susan Snay: living there, you know.

1101
02:15:21.570 --> 02:15:21.900
Anisha Hassan: I think.

1102
02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:23.760
Susan Snay: I think this struggle to because it's.

1103
02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:31.710
Susan Snay: they're so small, I mean maybe if we think of something a little bit bigger, like most of them know what a chicken egg is that's a single cell.

1104
02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.210
Sarah Michaels: You say Oh, really.

1105
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:36.330
Susan Snay: Oh yes, a chicken egg is a single cell.

1106
02:15:36.570 --> 02:15:38.760
Sarah Michaels: has to be, but I never saw that.

1107
02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.130
Jessica Zaleski: We didn't even think about it.

1108
02:15:41.130 --> 02:15:42.720
Jessica Zaleski: That way, true.

1109
02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:47.970
Susan Snay: yeah jag an ostrich egg is this a noun that is a single cell.

1110
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:50.730
Sarah Michaels: and never saw that before my life.

1111
02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:51.990
Jessica Zaleski: So we yeah.

1112
02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:53.280
Jessica Zaleski: We can talk about that.

1113
02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:04.980
Jessica Zaleski: You know when we're talking about humans, do you think you can see a human egg cell with your eyes, you know, like ask them that I mean, most of them are going to say no, can you see.

1114
02:16:05.010 --> 02:16:05.970
Susan Snay: Other and other.

1115
02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:07.020
Jessica Zaleski: other animals.

1116
02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:08.490
Susan Snay: help.

1117
02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:12.690
Sarah Michaels: And the community knows about the fish through reggie up.

1118
02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:18.240
Sarah Michaels: you're cool and then the Community will also get wait, what about a.

1119
02:16:18.330 --> 02:16:25.410
Sarah Michaels: chicken egg yeah so that's a beautiful but it's still a cell we keep reinforcing that that.

1120
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:29.550
Susan Snay: it's one cell that chicken egg will never have without the other gametes.

1121
02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:34.530
Sarah Michaels: yani has half the chromosome right, it has has to promise me and.

1122
02:16:34.530 --> 02:16:37.740
Jessica Zaleski: That egg that's why an egg in your fridge.

1123
02:16:37.770 --> 02:16:41.940
Jessica Zaleski: is never going to ever go into a baby chicken it's never been.

1124
02:16:41.970 --> 02:16:43.470
Susan Snay: Even when you put it under your pillow.

1125
02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:44.670
Jessica Zaleski: yeah it's.

1126
02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:52.560
Anisha Hassan: I mean technically an egg is it's like menstruation technically.

1127
02:16:52.890 --> 02:16:53.940
Anisha Hassan: Right yeah.

1128
02:16:54.630 --> 02:16:56.010
Susan Snay: yeah it was yeah.

1129
02:16:59.160 --> 02:16:59.610
Anisha Hassan: yeah.

1130
02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:00.000
Sarah Michaels: Just.

1131
02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:01.110
They just fade out.

1132
02:17:03.090 --> 02:17:05.880
Susan Snay: yeah but you can't see them in humans, because they're so tiny.

1133
02:17:06.570 --> 02:17:17.700
Sarah Michaels: Well, you know the point of this and it's take it's good it's taking us much longer than the amber recommend for face to face, and it would take us twice as long anyway now it's taking a bit longer.

1134
02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:25.440
Sarah Michaels: But the point is, I think they're on the cusp of getting it and I think most of them.

1135
02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:35.130
Sarah Michaels: I mean i'm well again we don't really know we that's why we have to get others who don't speak up to put it into their own words we're going to have to.

1136
02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:49.800
Sarah Michaels: keep asking you know when when Salaam says something or reggie is so beautiful he's so articulate but then we're going to have to get more of them to say what reggie said, and if they can't say it, they got to ask them to say it again, and he will.

1137
02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:51.840
Sarah Michaels: So.

1138
02:17:52.740 --> 02:18:04.200
Jessica Zaleski: I honestly think like looking ahead at the next few slides where we're going to talk about halfway they now understand having a framework for that, because of doing that activity.

1139
02:18:04.470 --> 02:18:14.520
Jessica Zaleski: That happily means happen there were six, there were six chromosomes and how many went into the sperm each time you flip the coin, only three right how many went into that so halfway.

1140
02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:27.120
Jessica Zaleski: Then it introduces I don't what do we call that fertilized egg the sperm the aggregate the zygote, so I think this will actually go pretty quickly through that because they have a frame of reference.

1141
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:35.670
Jessica Zaleski: I think, just and then there's some new terms to add to the glossary the Gani fertilization halfway cells, I go deployed sell.

1142
02:18:36.930 --> 02:18:54.990
Jessica Zaleski: The pictures with the half Lloyd and deployed and then even asking them like, why do we need to make special gametes cells that have half the normal number of chromosomes a lot of kids answered that, like my kids answered that in the breakout room, essentially because they said.

1143
02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:55.380
Susan Snay: well.

1144
02:18:55.590 --> 02:18:57.480
Susan Snay: plus three is a because.

1145
02:18:57.570 --> 02:19:15.780
Jessica Zaleski: Well, because nicki who hadn't been here yesterday said I said Okay, there are six how many are there in the man key Sean said six and how many are in the dad and the mom six and I and Nikki and I said and how many will be in the baby and Nikki said 12 and then Sabina said no.

1146
02:19:17.730 --> 02:19:24.390
Jessica Zaleski: Like and I said well why not, and she said it's not the same and Nikki said Oh, when we were.

1147
02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:29.790
Jessica Zaleski: Like I think they do have a frame of reference for all of that it's just.

1148
02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:31.170
Jessica Zaleski: So many pieces.

1149
02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.600
Jessica Zaleski: And strings to try to pull together, but I.

1150
02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:36.990
Sarah Michaels: Think they're getting it so.

1151
02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:46.650
Sarah Michaels: Okay, so I want to, I have to bring up, so I think we're on track we're going to complete it and it's sad that this is all we can.

1152
02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:54.210
Sarah Michaels: Do, but I think it's interesting to see that the kids with a lot of help, I mean they've got all of us all of.

1153
02:19:54.690 --> 02:20:03.960
Sarah Michaels: You know breakout rooms all that stuff but still I think it's I think they're I think these kids are great and I just wish we could continue.

1154
02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:16.590
Sarah Michaels: So I want to, I want to mention something which is that I have an undergraduate who wants to do a practice project for her undergraduate major.

1155
02:20:17.310 --> 02:20:32.070
Sarah Michaels: she's she's I don't know her all that well her name is jess Martin she wants to become an elementary teacher, but she loves science and he would like to work with us and.

1156
02:20:34.020 --> 02:20:44.160
Sarah Michaels: figure out what could possibly happen with these kids if there's any way to continue to support them so.

1157
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:56.280
Sarah Michaels: And i'm happy to work with her, and of course we've got the undergraduates and so, if the kids want to continue into you know, on on their own time.

1158
02:20:56.790 --> 02:21:07.260
Sarah Michaels: Just for the fun of it to maybe become ambassadors and maybe down the road next year, we could have them do some teaching of younger kids or something like that.

1159
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:12.690
Sarah Michaels: Would that be something so jess.

1160
02:21:13.890 --> 02:21:23.580
Sarah Michaels: she's interested in the virtual science pod it's ending, but we have all the videos so she could watch all of the videos she could do you know.

1161
02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:39.000
Sarah Michaels: I guess one question I have is Could I invite her to join us next week just introduce herself as another undergraduate and she'll just be there and observe so she'll have a sense of the kids and then she can work with.

1162
02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:52.680
Sarah Michaels: With the videos that we have, and then we can bring her into the the learning lab conversations and if there's a possibility to doing continuing with these kids it really would depend on what.

1163
02:21:53.130 --> 02:22:00.000
Sarah Michaels: Sue and JASMINE we have Nikki, in addition, but you know that's she's lovely but what you would like to.

1164
02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:11.340
Sarah Michaels: make possible for those kids who want to keep you know, keep thinking keep doing ember whatever we can you know we can take that off your shoulders.

1165
02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:23.340
Susan Snay: You can have i'm really concerned because we're going to be going back to school remote it's going to be this hybrid and I am so worried about.

1166
02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:36.720
Susan Snay: trying to figure out a new schedule and a new system and just trying to make it all work with my in my mind and then also help them through it, I just i'm afraid to commit to.

1167
02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:45.090
Susan Snay: Anything anything, not knowing what that's going to be like because i've really struggled with even this.

1168
02:22:46.260 --> 02:23:00.780
Sarah Michaels: Yes, well, so when you guys go back and you go back virtually is there any of this are you embracing anything, or do you want to I mean is there anything moving forward with your regular kids.

1169
02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:11.940
Sarah Michaels: In ninth grade biology that just could help with, even if just I mean do you do break up, you must do breakout rooms with half and half or no.

1170
02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:24.630
Jessica Zaleski: We do breakout rooms really to support the kids that just are not struggling doing work we actually have an IPA who's great who's.

1171
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:24.960
Susan Snay: In.

1172
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:37.470
Jessica Zaleski: Both of our classes with us now good wonderful um but no, I mean I was you know we are following Christine lloyd's scope and sequence that she set out.

1173
02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:54.870
Jessica Zaleski: Her curriculum map there for the year and we will be doing right at the end to right like in May, ecosystems and dynamics natural selection all of that, so I mean I think at that point.

1174
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.160
Sarah Michaels: could do ember it.

1175
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.210
Susan Snay: Should but see it.

1176
02:23:57.420 --> 02:24:05.700
Jessica Zaleski: Is the problem when we go back hybrid and March 29 we will be going back or March 22 okay.

1177
02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:07.140
Sarah Michaels: I don't believe it but.

1178
02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:08.460
Jessica Zaleski: wow that's what the school Committee I.

1179
02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:09.090
Jessica Zaleski: Can.

1180
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:12.000
Jessica Zaleski: tell you did you watch the school committee meeting because parents are ready to.

1181
02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:13.380
Susan Snay: burn the sign now.

1182
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:17.670
Jessica Zaleski: Okay um so anyway um.

1183
02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:19.530
Jessica Zaleski: Be.

1184
02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:25.740
Jessica Zaleski: The issue is that we will be simultaneously teaching this.

1185
02:24:26.250 --> 02:24:28.860
Jessica Zaleski: In front of us and the students who are at home.

1186
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:30.390
Susan Snay: At the same yes.

1187
02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:31.410
Jessica Zaleski: At the same.

1188
02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.610
Susan Snay: exact time.

1189
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:38.400
Jessica Zaleski: So essentially now Sue and I are in a situation where really I could work with the.

1190
02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:39.150
Susan Snay: kids yeah.

1191
02:24:39.390 --> 02:24:40.710
Jessica Zaleski: We are very fortunate.

1192
02:24:40.770 --> 02:24:51.330
Jessica Zaleski: Vice versa, but we also for our own sanity have to be mindful of how much time do we have to plan for that yet how much you know.

1193
02:24:53.370 --> 02:24:57.900
Sarah Michaels: It gets Okay, so that this all makes sense to me I guess what i'm asking is.

1194
02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:16.680
Sarah Michaels: Is there anything that another person jess could do for you as an assistant and continue to work with you in the fall and do her practice project in some way, shape or form around.

1195
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:28.950
Sarah Michaels: And you know Sue and justifying whatever it is you do, and if you say no i'm going to tell her no it's just not worth it, but I also know that you guys.

1196
02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:48.540
Sarah Michaels: need help So is there any help I mean we're also here to help you and and want to and, in fact, maybe there's a way down the road when you get to natural selection and stuff like that, then you call us back and say hey it would be great if we can have you know.

1197
02:25:49.650 --> 02:25:52.920
Sarah Michaels: Alma and raquel and you know, whatever.

1198
02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:59.190
Susan Snay: I mean that's a triangle that I think we have a really good grasp on the kids really do well in.

1199
02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:10.440
Susan Snay: yeah I mean I I would be willing to talk about that then But until then I would I hate to say, but I have to say no, because I got so i'm so.

1200
02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:14.580
Susan Snay: stressed about what it's going to be like I got.

1201
02:26:15.330 --> 02:26:17.580
Sarah Michaels: This job is to take stress off you.

1202
02:26:17.610 --> 02:26:23.490
Sarah Michaels: not add it on at all we've got we did what we said we would do and that's it.

1203
02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:28.920
Jessica Zaleski: Because we're not we're just not planned that far ahead.

1204
02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:29.430
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1205
02:26:29.490 --> 02:26:31.020
Susan Snay: I mean, I mean we were cagno.

1206
02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:38.460
Jessica Zaleski: planning a few days, I had and so to kind of know like where she could help us it's like i'm awesome.

1207
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:45.360
Sarah Michaels: let's wait too much longer when towards the end of the Semester if if, if at all.

1208
02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:50.880
Susan Snay: When we see what hybrids going to look like, how is it can even play out we don't even know if it's.

1209
02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:51.510
Susan Snay: All or no.

1210
02:26:51.600 --> 02:27:00.870
Jessica Zaleski: Other thing is to that you know i've been told repeatedly repeatedly by various sources that we at South high will be remote calm May.

1211
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:02.220
Jessica Zaleski: Regardless of life for.

1212
02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:02.760
Susan Snay: them to.

1213
02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:14.340
Jessica Zaleski: Because they have to knock the building down and pre coated the plan was always for us to go remote in May, I have been told that the power is being turned off in mid may in our building.

1214
02:27:14.490 --> 02:27:16.020
Jessica Zaleski: And they will demolish that building.

1215
02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:24.900
Jessica Zaleski: So I mean you know, and this is just a but i've heard it from enough reliable sources that I have no idea what the rest of the year is going to look like.

1216
02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:27.450
Susan Snay: Okay, and we won't know until.

1217
02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:30.480
Susan Snay: Like probably a week before if they give us a week.

1218
02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.690
Susan Snay: Exactly if that's the way it works it's terrible yeah.

1219
02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:45.990
Sarah Michaels: So okay that's fine we end next weekend we did a great thing we on our end can keep working on the discussion maps and all that stuff and anything we can think to.

1220
02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:53.160
Sarah Michaels: Make of this and then the plan will be when you know what things are like if there's any.

1221
02:27:53.700 --> 02:28:04.080
Sarah Michaels: possibility of anything amber like we'll try we'll figure it out, then we'll see what would be helpful and we'll go from there that's fine that I think that's perfect.

1222
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:17.880
Sarah Michaels: i'm happy with that and if we want to bring jess into the learning lab she can work with us and get to know amber and then you know there's a possibility down the road so that's how we'll leave it I feel great about that.

1223
02:28:20.850 --> 02:28:36.480
Sarah Michaels: And i'll talk with a nisha and everybody else about what it would maybe mean for us to have somebody who's not a paid research assistant, but she's interested in writing her you know ultimately hurt her thesis as a senior she's a junior now.

1224
02:28:37.650 --> 02:28:45.600
Sarah Michaels: And we'd have to meet her and talk with her stuff like that okay that's great I thought today was it was good.

1225
02:28:46.770 --> 02:28:49.290
Jessica Zaleski: I like it ended, well, I mean I was pretty.

1226
02:28:49.290 --> 02:28:49.950
Susan Snay: decided, with.

1227
02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:52.290
Susan Snay: One tough in the middle.

1228
02:28:53.610 --> 02:28:53.910
Sarah Michaels: yeah.

1229
02:28:54.270 --> 02:28:58.350
Jessica Zaleski: I was like really trying hard, I was like poker face poker face, because I was.

1230
02:28:58.470 --> 02:29:03.780
Sarah Michaels: You were brilliant you were brilliant when you said okay let's take this is a good place to take a break.

1231
02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:09.420
Sarah Michaels: yeah i'm it's interesting I love the fact that kids like.

1232
02:29:10.350 --> 02:29:25.950
Sarah Michaels: Leonardo and reggie will say, I have a question, or like i'm confused or something that's great when salon just says i'm confused and kind of gives up it's not helpful, but it is good that kids are you know I just feel like they're thinking.

1233
02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:36.840
Susan Snay: And then, and then it all came together when they saw the egg and sperm and the numbers that's when you were like oh geez they actually did get this a lot of it, which was nice.

1234
02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:41.430
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly exactly doing that activity was gratifying.

1235
02:29:41.490 --> 02:29:41.880
Susan Snay: Oh yeah.

1236
02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:53.640
Jessica Zaleski: They did get it so but I do think even how we handled it was better than if they had each gotten their own copy I can't quite imagine what would have happened.

1237
02:29:53.850 --> 02:30:01.590
Jessica Zaleski: I think the learning opportunity there would have been lost in the logistics of them trying to move the things around yep yep.

1238
02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:02.910
yeah.

1239
02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:06.180
Sarah Michaels: All right, all right.

1240
02:30:08.370 --> 02:30:09.150
Sarah Michaels: Week three.

1241
02:30:11.250 --> 02:30:14.220
Susan Snay: Right, so I have, I have access to that little list.

1242
02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:14.910
Jessica Zaleski: Right, you have.

1243
02:30:15.930 --> 02:30:18.330
Sarah Michaels: And with Nikki and nisha how.

1244
02:30:19.170 --> 02:30:24.750
Anisha Hassan: Do you want me, I mean I can send it to Jackson and she can forward it yeah.

1245
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:27.480
Jessica Zaleski: yeah that's fine because they can email me directly, so.

1246
02:30:28.110 --> 02:30:40.290
Sarah Michaels: And you know she's pulled some things together, so if she does watch it, it will make better sense because she's now you know she picked it up she's very I think she's very astute.

1247
02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:43.290
Sarah Michaels: and wonderful.

1248
02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:56.400
