00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.870
Susan Snay: frozen now or frozen.

89
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.480

90
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.920
Anisha Hassan: Absolutely okay.

91
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.900
Susan Snay: yeah that'll make it even better, because you look pretty much cause the nucleus to shatter already.

92
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.010
Anisha Hassan: Oh okay.

93
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:07.440
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so actually Okay, so we should take some time, maybe like right after the break to go over again like what everybody's going to need so that everybody's ready for tomorrow, that would be good.

94
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:21.720
Jessica Zaleski: All right, so last week we ended sessions six by playing around in breakout rooms, with the slides where we made.

95
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:36.990
Jessica Zaleski: A baby using the chromosomes from the mom and the dad and we talked we talked about how the chromosomes go from the dad to the sperm and from the mom to the egg and then.

96
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:54.720
Jessica Zaleski: They go, they are go together to make the baby now let's talk about does anyone remember how many chromosomes doesn't egg or a sperm have compared to an ordinary cell of that organism.

97
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.370
salam: I remember has three with no parents.

98
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:08.760
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, great so how many did the how many chromosomes did the parent have the mom or the dad when we were doing that activity.

99
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.240
three.

100
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.560
salam: pair I mean six chromosomes and three pairs.

101
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:20.970
Jessica Zaleski: Six chromosomes in three pairs exactly and then this the egg had three chromosomes and the.

102
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:38.340
Jessica Zaleski: sperm had three chromosomes okay so we're not we don't need to do that so i'm right in our notebook so because we just reviewed that and I think it's a good idea if we just, just in case anyone missed it here if we take a look here um we took.

103
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:53.160
Jessica Zaleski: from each pair we flipped a coin and we decided Okay, is it going to be a or B, I know, in my group key Sean was the coin flipper you did a fantastic job with that and he kept yelling out.

104
00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:09.300
Jessica Zaleski: heads or tails and it was a or B and we decided, you know which chromosome from the pair was going to go into that and we dragged down now who can tell me why is it who can remind us like, why is it.

105
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:21.000
Jessica Zaleski: Well, maybe we'll wait we'll hold on to that question I think we're going to talk about it in a little bit, but we did the we did the randomness i'm just randomly picking and we copied one.

106
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:39.480
Jessica Zaleski: from each pair okay into the sperm and one from each pair into the egg and then, when we combined them the baby had six chromosomes, just like the mother and the father did Okay, so let me go back here.

107
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.450
Susan Snay: Now, your group was able to make more than one baby right.

108
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:51.930
Jessica Zaleski: We made I think three or four yeah yeah our group didn't get to make that many okay.

109
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.310
Sarah Michaels: think we made to.

110
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.980
Sarah Michaels: Both but girls.

111
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:57.810
Sarah Michaels: Do.

112
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.600
Jessica Zaleski: You want to take this one missing the red.

113
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:07.710
Susan Snay: door Okay, so when when the egg and sperm are created.

114
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.880
Susan Snay: We caught another term that we use to.

115
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:24.510
Susan Snay: For each of those two different types of cells is called a gametes that's like the scientific, technical term, and if we use that term gametes we can use that.

116
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:36.570
Susan Snay: To describe egg and sperm cells from any organism, we could use those to describe the fish egg where the fish sperm.

117
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:50.910
Susan Snay: Or the human egg or the human sperm or the dog egg of the dog sperm if we say gametes it doesn't matter what species, that is, we could even use it to describe plants sex sells for insects excels okay.

118
00:13:51.840 --> 00:14:03.450
Susan Snay: Now, when we talk about the number of chromosomes that those cells have is a term that we use this code happily happily just means.

119
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:21.030
Susan Snay: half the number of chromosomes that would be in a normal body, so all right, and I always look at that the beginning part of that word hap and to me it sounds like half okay that's how I always remembered that halfway, it is half the chromosomes.

120
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:33.960
Jessica Zaleski: So i'm gonna snake, just to clarify, so I can say that there are like male gametes and female gametes and those are referring to.

121
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:47.430
Jessica Zaleski: The special sex cells that are half Lloyd, and that organism doesn't matter what organism, it is as long as it's a organism that reproduces actually, that is correct plant or animal okay.

122
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:58.710
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so gametes that's going to be an important word to remember, because we're going to use that term those of those special cells, they are not like ordinary cells.

123
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.530
Susan Snay: Yes, now like a skin so um.

124
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.000
Jessica Zaleski: So here's an important question, what is the cell called.

125
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:19.230
Jessica Zaleski: That is created when the egg in the sperm meet so we've got this half Lloyd sal this male hat from the mail and we've got the half Lloyd cell from the female, and you know in.

126
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:32.670
Jessica Zaleski: in humans it's a sperm and an egg and in many animals that's how we would refer to it well, what happened, what what is that thing called when they come together and they meet, what does that sound calls.

127
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:44.250
Jessica Zaleski: When the egg and sperm ne ne take a moment and think about it, what do you think it's called you may have heard this word before maybe not we'll just give you a few seconds.

128
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.470
Susan Snay: Everybody write something down.

129
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.960
Sarah Michaels: yeah if you had to make up a good word.

130
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.260
Jessica Zaleski: For.

131
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:56.970
Sarah Michaels: It you don't know the scientific word what what would be a good word that we could invent that would be the word for it.

132
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.360
salam: Yes, i'll be back I forgot to get my notebook.

133
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.770
Jessica Zaleski: So we have the sperm style.

134
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:20.880
Jessica Zaleski: And the ag cell and when they come fine, what do we call that cell that's created by that combination.

135
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.660
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, I see something in the chat.

136
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.900
Jessica Zaleski: All right, did anybody have any other ideas.

137
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.930
Jessica Zaleski: You Sean said zygote.

Nhi Huynh: um because it was created from the fusions have to have boy.

145
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.320

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:42.270
Jessica Zaleski: yeah Okay, so if you're if you've got a half late and a half light and you fuse together, you would have a deployed okay interesting very good.

150
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.680
Jessica Zaleski: boy.

151
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.610
Jessica Zaleski: No go ahead.

152
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.610
Sarah Michaels: Chris said combined like yeah.

153
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.120
Jessica Zaleski: And I.

154
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.890
Susan Snay: said fertilized Oh, I was wondering if somebody would come up with that word.

155
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.770
Jessica Zaleski: yeah all right let's take a look here.

156
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:12.840
Jessica Zaleski: You guys are kind of like this is a great combination of different ideas here, this is awesome so that that that special cell is called a zygote and what a zygote is is a fertilized egg.

157
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:34.590
Jessica Zaleski: it's the first cell of a baby of the organism right you can't have a baby just by having a sperm cell or an egg sell you have to put them together and that process is called fertilization, and that what's formed what's created is, as I go.

158
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:47.490
Jessica Zaleski: whoo this Nikki talked a little bit about this, the how how many people listening and paid attention to this right.

159
00:18:48.030 --> 00:19:08.550
Susan Snay: So, how does the number of chromosomes in a zygote a fertilized egg compare to the number in an egg or a sperm cell so, how does the number of chromosomes in a zygote compared to.

160
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.650
Reggie: The number of chromosomes we are weighing it down are we can give you the answer.

161
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.860
Reggie: Or we can write it down and give you the end.

162
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.090
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, you know what it says.

163
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:27.870
Jessica Zaleski: It says, you can write it down so go ahead and record your ideas in the notebook okay so just we'll just give you like 30 seconds, what do you think take a moment.

164
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:49.290
Jessica Zaleski: And I am actually you know misnamed we talked about me grabbing a visual aid or and I need to grab one off my counter okay.

165
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.070
Jessica Zaleski: Keeping everyone at this time i'll be right back.

166
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:09.210
Susan Snay: hi does everybody have some sort of description of how they think that number of chromosomes in the zygote compares to the number of chromosomes in an egg or in a sperm.

167
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.920
Susan Snay: Now we don't know what egg or sperm, or what zygote species, it is.

168
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.210
Susan Snay: i'm not sure it really matters.

169
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:25.980
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

170
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.920
Jessica Zaleski: Anybody have any ideas.

171
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:30.780
Reggie: nothing's.

172
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.110
Reggie: Yet, but I think there were waiting so So yes.

173
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:48.360
Reggie: So I said that's gonna be doubled, because it take almost pods chromosomes from each of them and then be combined into that, though, like one, so I think there's I goes I have like double then what's called the egg in the sperm so.

174
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.230
Jessica Zaleski: How many people agree with reggie.

175
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.820
Nhi Huynh: I agree with him.

176
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.870
Leandro Graterol: yeah you might be, what do you say because i'm gonna hate you.

177
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:06.660
Jessica Zaleski: here's the question can someone else repeat what reggie said and their own words for Leandro please.

178
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.140
salam: But reggie can you say again, please.

179
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.190
Yes.

180
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:15.570
Reggie: Yes.

181
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:23.700
Jessica Zaleski: I just want to see if somebody else who was who understood you, the first time reggie let's say somebody else say what explain what reggie explained.

182
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.310
Nhi Huynh: yeah so um he said that.

183
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:36.870
Nhi Huynh: There are, so the number is double compared to the number in it, or a spring because um I think they take each.

184
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:46.920
Nhi Huynh: One from the an inch from the sperm, so you know compiled together, it would double compared to the egg in the sperm.

185
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.050
Sarah Michaels: Could.

186
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:57.300
Sarah Michaels: Could somebody else put that it's a it's a complicated thing if somebody else say it thinks they understand it.

187
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.680
salam: um what I understood from what he said is like the two eggs are I mean.

188
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:06.750
salam: It is it.

189
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:18.480
salam: is like they're combined, this is what I understood, I guess, but I don't know how to put it in my own words.

190
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.290
salam: Can you.

191
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.200
Jessica Zaleski: tell us more about that so i'm like what is combined.

192
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.960
salam: The number of it.

193
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.840
Jessica Zaleski: OK, so the number of what.

194
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.200
salam: The egg and.

195
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.030
salam: I don't know how to say.

196
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.310
salam: bye.

197
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:43.560
Susan Snay: yeah bye, what are we talking about that's inside the egg and sperm, what have we been talking about those little lines.

198
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:53.700
salam: yeah so I don't think that when we ask you to rephrase this we're not we're not trying to.

199
00:22:53.970 --> 00:23:08.400
Susan Snay: see if you were paying attention, or anything like that or not paying attention we're asking you to think about what was said and try to process that makes sense of what it is in your own words so we're not trying to call anybody out no.

200
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:26.250
Jessica Zaleski: That was you guys did a great job with that and reggie had an excellent explanation we're just curious to see how exactly what mistakes at how you interpret what reggie said and process it and then how you can explain it to someone else so that was that was great okay so.

201
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.980
Susan Snay: all it takes is like one different way to explain it to have someone else understand.

202
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.520
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so you guys said it it's doubled it's twice as many you get half.

203
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:55.320
Jessica Zaleski: From the mother and half from the father and it's going to double the number of chromosomes so that that organism will have the same number of chromosomes as its mother and father do okay all right there it is there's that little.

204
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.630
salam: Do a copy this.

205
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.750
Jessica Zaleski: I know you don't need to copy but.

206
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:07.740
Sarah Michaels: Could I get somebody to put that line in their own words so again what's.

207
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:08.940
Susan Snay: You mean the red line.

208
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:15.210
Sarah Michaels: yeah like just to say that because that's like numbers and all that stuff Can somebody explain that.

209
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:25.140
Sarah Michaels: How, how does the number of chromosomes in a zygote compared to the number and an egg or a sperm somebody can add idea.

210
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.610
Reggie: i'm gonna say miss.

211
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.680
Reggie: So on say like okay so we'd like to own the one we did a while ago right and they both had three right.

212
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:47.100
Reggie: So um you basically take those three there in like the sperm and the egg cells put them into the arm, it was called as I go and when you do that as a combined into almost got three periods of six.

213
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.670
Susan Snay: Very good, so the three where did the three come from.

214
00:24:54.210 --> 00:25:08.970
Reggie: The three came from you, like the mom or the dad which duplicates like the egg and the sperm so that goes it says, I go in and you'll be like three pairs of them have six of them say the same my step mom or the dad depending on how much chromosomes they have.

215
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.020
salam: Is it because, like each of them like gives one.

216
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.440
salam: Look from each one's one for me.

217
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.770
Sarah Michaels: What each.

218
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.910
salam: Each one like one chromosomes from each.

219
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.490
Jessica Zaleski: from each, what do you remember what those are called.

220
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.810
salam: For me, oh.

221
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.750
salam: And by.

222
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.070
Sarah Michaels: Are you trying to say sperm.

223
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.170
salam: Yes, firm sperm.

224
00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.470
Jessica Zaleski: Are they giving one from each egg and sperm, where does that, where does the one originally come from.

225
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:52.320
salam: So one of um I mean miss I am confused one from the mom and then one from the dad and it gives it to the arm.

226
00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:09.690
salam: So one from the mom it gives it to the AG, and one from the dad to the egg and then another one from them, because when we flip the coin, what that's what we did we took from it one of them like one pair done for this.

227
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.330
Sarah Michaels: form.

228
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.960
salam: yeah we did the same thing I guess.

229
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:24.150
Susan Snay: So I think what I heard you say was that you took one when you flip the coin, you took one of the pair.

230
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.550
From the bomb is that right.

231
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.150
salam: yeah but we copy it we've copied it.

232
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.670
Susan Snay: Okay, so you made sure you had a copy.

233
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:41.070
salam: yeah cuz i'm it will not make sense if we like just isn't she's not gonna have enough chrome song.

234
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.080
Okay.

235
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.550
Jessica Zaleski: So we're gonna look so let me just.

236
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:48.330
Give.

237
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.600
Leandro Graterol: you read what it says.

238
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.720
Jessica Zaleski: In the classroom no I didn't because i'm in.

239
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.860
Doing this right now.

240
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.070
Leandro Graterol: I wouldn't be able to join today because i'm.

241
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:11.430
Jessica Zaleski: OK OK OK so he's not going to be able to join us, thank you Leandro for for letting us know, thank you so.

242
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.720
Susan Snay: much I appreciate that.

243
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.660
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so.

244
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:30.450
Sarah Michaels: So I just I want somebody else i'm still a tiny bit confused about what reggie said could somebody else who hasn't yet said anything put that idea into their own words.

245
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.570
Sarah Michaels: Chris or the Andrew or Sabina or angie or me.

246
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:42.060
Sarah Michaels: Make sure Salaam is clear, so so explain one more time.

247
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.440
Sarah Michaels: catlin anyone.

248
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.590
Sarah Michaels: Who hasn't who you who who thinks they get it.

249
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.820
Sarah Michaels: thinks they get this idea raise your hand.

250
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.370
salam: This I can't get it, but like so confused.

251
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.140
Sarah Michaels: yeah so somebody.

252
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.360
Jessica Zaleski: And I think, maybe we should look at the next slide which kind of reviews the whole process.

253
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:32.610
Jessica Zaleski: And then maybe someone would feel more confident to explain it in their own words just because we're kind of just looking at a lot of words, and the next slide has pictures associated with it, that might help to.

254
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:42.540
Jessica Zaleski: Like tie this all up and then i'd love to hear what some of them have to say about like explain the process, using the pictures so let's take a look at this so.

255
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:54.570
Jessica Zaleski: chromosomes which our DNA molecules are carried to the offspring by gametes right they come from the mom and dad as egg and sperm.

256
00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:09.060
Jessica Zaleski: And gametes are different from other cells, because they're halfway they have half the number of chromosomes as original cells so let's take a look at those these pictures, as they come up.

257
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:28.080
Jessica Zaleski: here's kind of what we did in the Google in this slide deck right we have mom here with her three pairs and dad here with his three pairs and when mom creates egg cells she's not giving three pairs she's giving.

258
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.540
Jessica Zaleski: One from each pair.

259
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:41.250
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and how is how do we decide how does the mom decide which chromosome from each pair to give to her eggs.

260
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.790
salam: Then they gave me.

261
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:51.570
Susan Snay: Maybe if I just think really hard, I can give my eggs certain chromosomes.

262
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.250
Reggie: I think, is just random.

263
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.970
Jessica Zaleski: me say that again reggie.

264
00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.520
Reggie: I think it's random.

265
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.140
Jessica Zaleski: it's random.

266
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:05.130
Susan Snay: Did we do anything in the activity that kind of showed that it might be random.

267
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.780
Reggie: um we flipped a coin and then.

268
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.830
Reggie: whichever one it gives headed to he has picked him putting into the of address form so.

269
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:12.780
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

270
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:22.200
Jessica Zaleski: you're right it's just random it's just what However, the organisms well I say body, you know, however.

271
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:40.890
Jessica Zaleski: in humans, however, our body decides to create it right, however, those out yeah and same with the dad he's going to give one from each pair but it's random how it which ones, just like when we flipped the coin, every time it was heads or tails it was random we didn't know which one.

272
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.310
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so half Lloyd.

273
00:30:46.380 --> 00:31:01.740
Jessica Zaleski: Wright fertilization, is when the egg in the sperm are combined I love that Nikki said what was the word that Nikki used can does anybody remember the word that Nikki used to describe the combining.

274
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.840
Jessica Zaleski: started with an ass.

275
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.880
needs to have these little beads when the kids were younger that thing would lay down and colors and iron over them.

276
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.310
Jessica Zaleski: And if anybody remembers those it is fertilization.

277
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:29.010
Susan Snay: that's the process that's all it yes that's not the term that she she's a different term.

278
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.860
of making them kind of stick together, I think, Christopher said combined.

279
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.610
Sarah Michaels: Somebody asked me to Nikki to say it again.

280
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.380
Nhi Huynh: um the word is fusion.

281
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.330
Jessica Zaleski: Fusion fusion alright, so that joining.

282
00:31:51.360 --> 00:32:01.200
Jessica Zaleski: Together yeah so fertile it like miss major said the fertilization is the process of the gametes using to gather.

283
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:24.300
Jessica Zaleski: and producing as I go and there's bad zygote is the first cell have a baby okay so remember a baby is not just a sperm or an egg a baby is the zygote formed by the fertilizing of the gametes those gametes confusing together and producing as I go.

284
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:36.510
Susan Snay: So that zygote will be the very first cell complete cell that will be able to reproduce and form that offspring that whole offspring.

285
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:45.420
Jessica Zaleski: And because I goats are deployed in our example here how many chromosomes will the zygote have.

286
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.890
three.

287
00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.260
Take a look at.

288
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:51.450
Reggie: six.

289
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.610
Susan Snay: Six why.

290
00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.470
salam: lecture and three pairs.

291
00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:58.950
Sarah Michaels: Why.

292
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:10.350
Reggie: Because it take the arm chromosomes from like their egg and sperm cells and there's going to transfer into the zygote is basically going to give it six because he didn't have three.

293
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:19.950
Jessica Zaleski: awesome this is fertilization egg and sperm coming together and there's the baby.

294
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.440
Jessica Zaleski: bears the zygote.

295
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.710
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly great job.

296
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:27.810
Jessica Zaleski: All right, and it's dead wide.

297
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.250
Jessica Zaleski: Just like it's parents.

298
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.130
Susan Snay: Is that a male or female whoo.

299
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:33.810
Reggie: Yes, me.

300
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.640
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, why.

301
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.250
Susan Snay: Can you explain how you understand that because I don't i'm just looking at blue and red lines.

302
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:47.040
Reggie: You just got to look at the last two pairs to page i'll tell you the male or female.

303
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.630
Susan Snay: Last two pairs.

304
00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.140
yeah.

305
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.120
Right.

306
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.610
Reggie: I mean the last pair.

307
00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:08.190
salam: How do I know is the female in the has like straight lines they're both matching but the male has the X, Y so one of them is shorter and one of them's like longer than the other one.

308
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.450
Oh Okay, so all right, thank you.

309
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:22.290
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so our mom and dad's original cells original cells are they have Lloyd or deployed.

310
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.450
Nhi Huynh: deploying deploying.

311
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:25.680
deploying.

312
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.780
Susan Snay: What is deployed mean.

313
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.630
Nhi Huynh: So I know that.

314
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:35.400
Nhi Huynh: The deep.

315
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.130
Nhi Huynh: dive part is too.

316
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.890
Nhi Huynh: And I think deploy is like three.

317
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.710
Nhi Huynh: How say that tree tree set up to.

318
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.580
Susan Snay: OK, so the prefix di.

319
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:53.940
Nhi Huynh: yeah.

320
00:34:54.330 --> 00:35:03.570
Susan Snay: You know that di means to yeah so okay so that's how you determine deployed would be the two chromosomes together.

321
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:15.780
Jessica Zaleski: yeah, can I ask a question does anyone remember how many pairs of chromosomes in a human being.

322
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.310
salam: wanted three.

323
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:30.390
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so 23 pairs so how many chromosomes in a deployed and a human deployed Sao.

324
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.580
salam: Luis like miss Alma parents right chromosomes.

325
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.500
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

326
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:45.090
Jessica Zaleski: How many Can somebody else say what, if you agree or disagree with the law firm, can you say that again.

327
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.770
salam: Is it 46 miss are we talking about this one, or like.

328
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.720
Jessica Zaleski: we're talking about a human, I asked about a human.

329
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.650
salam: With six.

330
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.120
Jessica Zaleski: All right.

331
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.670
Susan Snay: So.

332
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:02.670
Sarah Michaels: So Salam said 46 I think could somebody say why.

333
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.020
salam: i'm sure i'm sure it's.

334
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.100
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, she.

335
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.500
Sarah Michaels: Could somebody else say why do you think Salaam is sure.

336
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.480
Sarah Michaels: Just because it's divided by let somebody else turns that.

337
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.580
Reggie: We see that again.

338
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.750
Sarah Michaels: Why do you think Salaam says she's sure.

339
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.570
Sarah Michaels: it's 46 she's not just guessing but she's sure.

340
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:34.590
Reggie: How to gain a few classes ago we looked at church on how much chromosomes each thing has and how much.

341
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:41.790
Reggie: How much deep deploys they have like combined we looked at that, like maybe few classes ago.

342
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.810
Susan Snay: Oh, the carrier type the picture of the chromosomes lined up.

343
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:46.380
yeah.

344
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:55.950
Sarah Michaels: And so, when she said i'm sure it's 46 what is she thinking inside her head, that this is a human.

345
00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.430
Sarah Michaels: Andrew.

346
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.540
Sarah Michaels: You know why she thinks it's got to be 46.

347
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:22.740
Reggie: Because when we looked at the thing there combines which was 2323 and if you're going to do them like like one by one, is amit basically what's by that by two which will end up making a be 46 oh there's another nice way to do it just you.

348
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.450
Susan Snay: just said multiply by two.

349
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:36.960
Leandro Graterol: But divide divide a deacon or you can like 23 plus turning trees gonna give you give you 46 that's the easy way.

350
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:47.670
Susan Snay: that's another easy way to do it there's more than one way to figure out deployed in halfway you're absolutely right and that's why it's so cool to listen to the way you guys are processing this.

351
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.370
Jessica Zaleski: awesome very, very good okay.

352
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.030
salam: Mr, we have to write anything from the screen.

353
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.350
Sarah Michaels: know which.

354
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:06.960
Sarah Michaels: Remember, you have to be able to think about it, so if we if we came we met up tomorrow, and I said what's a you know.

355
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.120
Sarah Michaels: What to remember it.

356
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:24.120
Susan Snay: If something if something really kind of stands out and really make sense to you yeah you can always you know right jot down something in your notebook whenever saying you don't have to, but you know if it makes sense to you want to write it down go ahead.

357
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.370
Sarah Michaels: Go ahead help you yep.

358
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:51.030
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so let's take a look at another question related to this, so let's try to make sense of one more thing here, why do we need to make special gametes cells sperm and egg that have half the number of normal chromosomes so take a minute.

359
00:38:52.080 --> 00:39:02.310
Jessica Zaleski: Think about everything we've been talking about and jot down some thoughts in your notebook like, why do we need those.

360
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.610
Jessica Zaleski: Half Lloyd cells.

361
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:16.380
Jessica Zaleski: With half the number of chromosomes I know some of these questions, almost sound the same but they're slightly different so.

362
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:31.470
Susan Snay: We want you to go with this alright so let's let's really look at this question closely and say why do we need to make special gametes cells that have half the normal number of chromosomes.

363
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.300
Jessica Zaleski: Take a moment and think about that and then we'll share out with the group.

364
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:35.370
Susan Snay: But he has something written down some sort of idea why we need special gaming cells, with one half the normal number of chromosomes.

365
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.300
Jessica Zaleski: So I could ask another question to like if we didn't have.

366
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.260
Jessica Zaleski: Halfway blood cells that had half the number.

367
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.410
Jessica Zaleski: What would happen.

368
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.870
Susan Snay: I was just gonna ask the same thing.

369
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:04.650
Reggie: um, what do you need to be like a different animal or a different I don't i'm not sure it would be like a mutation or it'd be like something different.

370
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:14.190
Reggie: Because it won't have a disarmed, the same amount of chromosomes as the mother, father, which might end up making it differently i'm not sure what's going to happen with him it's not a look to see.

371
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:15.540
salam: yeah.

372
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.820
I think it's like if it didn't have the same number of course it's going to have something wrong.

373
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:30.990
salam: or like that kid will look different like you know what i'm saying like.

374
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:38.100
salam: I don't know how to explain it, but the kid might look different and.

375
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.930
salam: might not have to be like i'm like.

376
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.390
This.

377
00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:53.640
salam: If it was a human will look different like you know how they cost special kids I guess.

378
00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:03.660
Susan Snay: So maybe maybe we you or some of us know human beings that may look a little different.

379
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:07.470
I wonder if that has anything to do with chromosomes.

380
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:18.510
Jessica Zaleski: Take I brought up the chart that reggie was talking about earlier um so we said that in a human.

381
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:26.820
Jessica Zaleski: We have 26 total chromosomes right from 23 pairs 23 so i'm said you multiply you can divide.

382
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:40.050
Jessica Zaleski: You know, you can multiply it to get the individual numbers or divide to get the pairs, but we have 46 chromosomes in each of ourselves, and if we didn't produce.

383
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:59.370
Jessica Zaleski: deploy half blood cells that had half that number when we gave when we formed to combine two when we formed a zygote how many chromosomes would that offspring have or how many chromosomes would that zygote have we can think about a human.

384
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:03.690
yeah what would happen if we didn't.

385
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.030
Reggie: Oh yes, yeah how much number of chromosomes have.

386
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:09.780
yeah.

387
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.650
Reggie: I mean they have like 92.

388
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.660
Jessica Zaleski: How did you get that reggie.

389
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:27.780
Reggie: Because you're saying was cool okay so have we still going to take like half of one, the number and put it in, but if you're saying they didn't then both them I have 46 which means you have to multiply that by two.

390
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.470
Jessica Zaleski: that's gonna be a lot of chromosomes wow.

391
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:39.810
Sarah Michaels: If somebody put that idea into their own words, what reggie said, who thinks they understand what what red team names.

392
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:44.850
salam: Does he, like i'm so we're talking about humans right miss.

393
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:47.160
Jessica Zaleski: I think that's what.

394
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.920
salam: I guess he multiplied by the number of pairs with the numbers of chromosomes.

395
00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:04.680
salam: i'm i'm with i'm with miss, let me try to do and i'll see if i'm right or wrong, I guess that that's what he did.

396
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.880
Sarah Michaels: He Sean has his hand up oh you Sean.

397
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:09.600
Go ahead.

398
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.060
Keyshawn: That that'd be a problem.

399
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:26.970
Jessica Zaleski: Do you think it would be a problem key Sean if I humans I go had 96 or 92 chromosomes.

400
00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.660
Keyshawn: Yes.

401
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:34.170
Jessica Zaleski: Do you think it would be a viable human offspring, if it had 92 chromosomes.

402
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:35.070
No.

403
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:46.350
Susan Snay: Okay, do you think it's possible for any humans to have more than 46 chromosomes and be viable.

404
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.030
huh.

405
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.180
Reggie: No, no.

406
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.410
Jessica Zaleski: Well let's take a look at something.

407
00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.720
Leandro Graterol: Okay yeah but like, if you think about it, I think you know.

408
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:26.490
Jessica Zaleski: Oh we're talking about the difference between 46 going from 46 chromosomes which we should have 292 chromosomes which is double that's a huge difference right huge difference like how many chromosomes are in this carrier type, this is a hue an actual human stereotype alerting.

409
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.210
Susan Snay: Human.

410
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:37.980
Jessica Zaleski: This is a viable living human exactly how many chromosomes are in this stereotype 4646.

411
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.480
look closely.

412
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.390
salam: 47 seven years there's 47.

413
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.200
salam: Cars where is the there's an extra one.

414
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.010
Jessica Zaleski: Oh so extra.

415
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.240
salam: Little tiny chromosome number 21 there's an extra chromosome number 21.

416
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:04.080
Jessica Zaleski: boy that's small yeah and I see pear pear pear hairs.

417
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:12.450
Reggie: Oh 21 has three chromosomes 21 has three chromosomes We said that this is a living human being.

418
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:23.640
Jessica Zaleski: So do so, is it possible to have more than 46 chromosomes and still be a viable human.

419
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.320
salam: yeah yeah.

420
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:38.310
Jessica Zaleski: What do you think would be the result of this, I mean we were telling you this is a living human, but what do you think what might be some differences.

421
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:39.000
When.

422
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:45.570
Reggie: Their hair color maybe I color something something might be different or look different from like their actual.

423
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.380
salam: Parents yeah.

424
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:51.990
Susan Snay: Oh, you do you mean like different from mom or different from dad.

425
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.790
Reggie: or different.

426
00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:06.930
Reggie: OK OK, I think about the twins you looked at yesterday, how many of them was on different so i'm saying, maybe like that on like one chromosome good results in each one of them being different from the other.

427
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:22.440
Jessica Zaleski: So do you think that this is having 40 if having 47 chromosomes like this stereotype has do you think this is like just.

428
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:32.010
Jessica Zaleski: Typical to have like oh one or two more do you think this is kind of an abnormality or something that is rare that happens.

429
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:34.890
Reggie: we're.

430
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.970
Sarah Michaels: agree is, I think, is.

431
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:39.510
fair.

432
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.050
salam: Because I don't think a lot of people.

433
00:47:45.990 --> 00:48:03.870
Sarah Michaels: and telling us that humans typically have 23 pairs 46 so you wouldn't be telling us that, if some had 47 and some had 42 you know you are telling us all humans pretty much have.

434
00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.660
Sarah Michaels: So it makes sense that it would be.

435
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:14.790
Jessica Zaleski: Did kesha kesha did you have your hand up again or i'm sorry I just saw that was that from earlier or was that for now.

436
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.760
Jessica Zaleski: I see your hand up what do you want to share key Sean.

437
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.360
Sarah Michaels: Anybody anybody have.

438
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:49.770
Susan Snay: Any ideas what we might what having an extra number 21 chromosome what this.

439
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.360
Jessica Zaleski: could mean I think he Sean was just about to tell us.

440
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:54.990
Susan Snay: All right.

441
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.640
Keyshawn: I think it's rare.

442
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.310
Jessica Zaleski: You think it's rare okay.

443
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.900
Susan Snay: And I actually have.

444
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.540
One of my cousins.

445
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.690
Leandro Graterol: was born with this.

446
00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:38.340
Jessica Zaleski: So an extra 21st chromosome, it is very rare miss a what is it called what is the condition called when there is a third chromosome on pair 21 you mean.

447
00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.730
Susan Snay: This particular other than trisomy meaning tried meaning.

448
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.410
Jessica Zaleski: This is actually.

449
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.000
Susan Snay: down's syndrome.

450
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.970
Susan Snay: And you probably know of somebody who has down syndrome.

451
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:53.400
Leandro Graterol: yup.

452
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:58.680
Susan Snay: That extra that extra chromosome extra number 21 chromosome.

453
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:11.190
Susan Snay: codes for specific features that are true to most children are most people with down syndrome, they have very similar features.

454
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.230
Jessica Zaleski: So do you think that having that extra chromosome.

455
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:26.820
Jessica Zaleski: affects like hair color or eye color or you know hair texture or something like that, or do you think it affects.

456
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:37.530
Jessica Zaleski: It changes the organism, I mean again we're talking about a human here, so it changes the human more than that.

457
00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.670
Reggie: I think change this is rare.

458
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.410
Susan Snay: Does anybody know anyone with down syndrome.

459
00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.060
Nhi Huynh: yeah yeah.

460
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.920
salam: I know a lot of people.

461
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:59.700
Susan Snay: So, are there any other any special situations or medical issues that those that people with down syndrome.

462
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.630
You know, need to be concerned about or having issues with.

463
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.790
salam: yeah.

464
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.970
Jessica Zaleski: Oh angie said mental okay.

465
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.530
salam: yeah one of them that I know they have no leg.

466
00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.710
And that could be a problem I guess.

467
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:19.380
Okay.

468
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:31.230
Jessica Zaleski: So if anybody is not sure what down syndrome is I put it in the chat so you can always Google that if you're not sure exactly what that means, or what it means in English and geez.

469
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:45.360
Jessica Zaleski: Any other you know physical or mental differences with a person with down syndrome versus a person with 46 chromosomes.

470
00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:55.830
Sarah Michaels: Nina said can't walk is that is that a characteristic of a down syndrome I didn't know that.

471
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:06.300
salam: This actually i'm down syndrome kids everyone says look there's Buddha smart.

472
00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.000
salam: And that could be really special.

473
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:12.360
salam: and

474
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.980
Jessica Zaleski: If we should put up a picture yeah we can do that because.

475
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.570
Reggie: We miss yeah.

476
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:29.310
Reggie: So if you have a guy stroke on it goes okay like resolve into like having like being able to like here and stuff like that, like when you were dead like what when you were born to that effect it.

477
00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:34.140
Susan Snay: Okay, do you mean have extra abilities.

478
00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:43.230
Sarah Michaels: I think he means if you had if you're born deaths, does that mean you might have an extra chromosome oh.

479
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:44.820
Oh.

480
00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.980
Susan Snay: I don't have the answer to that I don't know.

481
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.760
Jessica Zaleski: Some things you know some.

482
00:52:54.900 --> 00:53:05.340
Jessica Zaleski: birth defects are genetic and some I mean like at the chromosomal level, and some are not right misnamed I mean.

483
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:27.330
Jessica Zaleski: are just from the way you know different things can happen as a fetus is developing and some things again are at the level of the chromosome down syndrome it or trisomy 21 is one of those and look at this, we talked about why, why do you think this is called try Sony 21.

484
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.130
Reggie: Because there's three chromosomes where i'm 21 years later 21 here.

485
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:36.630
Jessica Zaleski: You go yeah.

486
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:47.190
Jessica Zaleski: This is on the 23rd chromosome if we go back there for a second on the 21st chromosome, there are three and what is that prefix try mean.

487
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:48.810
Reggie: three.

488
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:52.320
Jessica Zaleski: Three there you go try so high yeah.

489
00:53:53.610 --> 00:54:04.500
Jessica Zaleski: All right, and there it is it's caused by the presence of all or even just part of a third copy of chromosome 21.

490
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:10.950
Susan Snay: That little tiny one of the smallest chromosomes and extra one of those will cause down send them.

491
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:16.770
Jessica Zaleski: And you don't even have to have a full copy of the extra one, it could just be part of it, so it says.

492
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:25.230
Susan Snay: yeah you can see the in the description, it says that could be physical growth delays mild to moderate intellectual disability.

493
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:42.150
Susan Snay: And then very characteristic facial features of the majority of people with down syndrome will will have very similar shaped eyes their nose their facial features will look very similar because of that extra 21 we're part of an extra 21.

494
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:49.500
Sarah Michaels: And angie said does the Bongo people have to do with this to.

495
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.750
Jessica Zaleski: happen.

496
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.140
rating.

497
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.450
Susan Snay: Questions are coming out.

498
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.280
Jessica Zaleski: I know angie you're going to be so you owe this and see this is exciting for you guys.

499
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:15.540
Jessica Zaleski: Because we haven't even done this in class yet, but when we actually talk about this at school in biology class and then we start talking about genetics and how some of these things happen.

500
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:22.800
Jessica Zaleski: There are angie my favorite part of biology is genetics and talking about this is all cool things that go on.

501
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.930
Susan Snay: Now you got me really excited I.

502
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:29.910
Jessica Zaleski: can't wait, I know, wait until we get into this and that's coming up really soon right miss me.

503
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:30.720
Susan Snay: Yes, yeah.

504
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:46.830
Jessica Zaleski: I think genetics is coming up really soon so, so I would say angie um hang on to that hang on to that thought you are in the right train of thought it definitely has something to do with genetics, but not exactly the same way you're going to find out about that okay.

505
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.440
Susan Snay: So I think we're going to remember it because you're curious and you want to know.

506
00:55:53.730 --> 00:56:08.400
Jessica Zaleski: I think we can see from this that it's really critical that cells, when they are create those sperm and egg cells, when they are created that they have the exact.

507
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:28.590
Jessica Zaleski: Number of chromosomes that they are supposed to have so in a human egg that's going to be 23 individual chromosomes and in a human sperm 23 individual chromosomes so when they join together as that zygote they have a exactly how many.

508
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:36.780
Jessica Zaleski: 4746 46 exactly we need.

509
00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.550
Jessica Zaleski: To have that 46, because if we have even a little bit extra.

510
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:47.520
Jessica Zaleski: On one pair of chromosomes we can have there can be significant.

511
00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:54.090
Jessica Zaleski: Difficulties exactly the significant changes on any organism.

512
00:56:54.420 --> 00:57:08.910
Sarah Michaels: In me says does twins can twins both is identical twins could they both have down syndrome if could, if they had an extra chromosome on the 21st.

513
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.080
Susan Snay: Oh wow.

514
00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:30.450
Jessica Zaleski: Maybe we should talk we don't really talk about that, but let's talk about that for a minute okay let's go back to let's talk about identical twins for a minute Okay, I want to go back and look at this picture right word identical me yeah.

515
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.990
Jessica Zaleski: What do you know about identical twins.

516
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.640
Reggie: They look the same.

517
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:52.440
salam: Is that it I think i'm identical twins is like they don't look the same but they're still twins they are twins what like they don't really look the same they have some different like.

518
00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.050
Sarah Michaels: Two different ideas share.

519
00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:59.490
Jessica Zaleski: yeah two very different ideas does anybody know any identical twins.

520
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:11.070
Jessica Zaleski: On the android you know how to say twins in Spanish, how do you say twins and Spanish.

521
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.210
Leandro Graterol: may look.

522
00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:16.140
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so how would you say identical twins.

523
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:24.060
Jessica Zaleski: identical Okay, it goes okay that's very yeah do you know any identical twins Leandro.

524
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.380
um.

525
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:32.550
Leandro Graterol: He I will say yeah but they don't they don't look the same but they look.

526
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:36.570
Leandro Graterol: Like the same thing and the eyes.

527
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:41.190
Susan Snay: You can tell them apart, is that what you're saying you can tell the difference with their.

528
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:42.000
Leandro Graterol: Part so.

529
00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.660
Susan Snay: So, are they identical that if you can tell.

530
00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.260
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: them apart.

531
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.140
Susan Snay: or they identical yeah.

532
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:55.800
Jessica Zaleski: Now Edwin said that he knows some identical twins Edwin can you unmute and tell us about those identical twins.

533
00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:00.030
Edwin Bermejo: Well, they look like exactly exactly the same okay.

534
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:04.680
Jessica Zaleski: Is this sounds like friends of yours, or our relatives my family members.

535
00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.820
Jessica Zaleski: family members.

536
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.710
Susan Snay: So, can you tell the difference between them.

537
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.030
Edwin Bermejo: Well, when I see them I get confused about which ones which one.

538
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.180
Jessica Zaleski: And are they are they.

539
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:19.860
Jessica Zaleski: Like a brother and brother sister and sister or brother and sister.

540
00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.090
Edwin Bermejo: brothers and brothers.

541
00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.370
Jessica Zaleski: brothers and brothers okay.

542
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:25.860
salam: Hello must.

543
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:30.810
Sarah Michaels: Be should get or so, first of all I think Nora said.

544
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.960
Sarah Michaels: y'all said they know.

545
00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:36.150
Jessica Zaleski: Julie said she knows.

546
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:37.290
Jessica Zaleski: You will lead up.

547
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.030
Sarah Michaels: So who do you know.

548
00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.390
Sarah Michaels: And do they look exactly alike.

549
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:50.970
yulie: yeah they do I don't know their names, but they went on my bus and they're in my class.

550
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:54.750
yulie: With an S, though.

551
00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:04.140
Jessica Zaleski: Now, usually tell me these like two brothers two sisters or a brother and a sister two sisters two sisters Okay, so we had.

552
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:08.460
Susan Snay: One example is two brothers and then julie's example is two sisters.

553
01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:12.720
Jessica Zaleski: and Chris said he knows who Chris tell us about the identical twins that you know.

554
01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.520
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: I have.

555
01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.980
schools that are identical.

556
01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:20.520
Jessica Zaleski: uncle so brothers their brothers.

557
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.690
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: yeah any.

558
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.290
Jessica Zaleski: tiny.

559
01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:26.460
CHRISTOPHER WINFIELD: thing that's and then I and then, I have two friends that are identical twins and their sisters.

560
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.780
Jessica Zaleski: And their sisters two.

561
01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:38.640
Jessica Zaleski: sisters Okay, and then reggie just because we're trying to get a great sample size here reggie, you said you know some identical twins tell us about the identical twins you know.

562
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:51.180
Reggie: So i'm almost every day i'm dealing with Blackberry across from us or basic neighbors yeah I used to play basketball with them, they both looked exactly the same, the only week it's like they both act different though that's I could tell them apart.

563
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:52.740
Reggie: and

564
01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.080
Jessica Zaleski: brothers, sisters or a brother and sister.

565
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:55.950
Reggie: brother brother.

566
01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:01.440
Jessica Zaleski: brother brother, I think I can do you know any identical twins.

567
01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:03.840
Raquel Fernandes: Yes, my brothers are identical twin.

568
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:12.420
Jessica Zaleski: brothers are identical does anybody see like a pattern going on here with all the identical twins that we've been talking about.

569
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.100
Reggie: They usually the same gender.

570
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.640
Reggie: Usually, yes, sometimes they could be a brother and sister they look exactly the same.

571
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.930
Susan Snay: A brother and a sister could look exactly the same.

572
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:26.790
Reggie: Yes.

573
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:41.400
salam: um I guess from what they said I don't know what identical mean but from what they said, I guess, they look the same and they're the same gender like it was a girl, and the girl have to be like 30 identical and they look the same.

574
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:48.030
Jessica Zaleski: Well let's talk a little bit about what you guys mean by look the same right, I mean when you say look the same.

575
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:54.480
Jessica Zaleski: reggie let's go a little bit more with what you're thinking you're saying they look the same what parts of them look the same.

576
01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:58.350
Reggie: The face.

577
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.480
Reggie: facial features so.

578
01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:06.840
Susan Snay: Okay, so are you saying you couldn't tell the difference between a sister and a brother that were.

579
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:17.940
Reggie: twins yeah I couldn't tell the same alyssa to get had a different hairstyle or like when I talked to them, because they talk like Muslim like that different from each other, there.

580
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:23.310
Jessica Zaleski: was a brother and a sister you couldn't tell who was the boy who is the girl.

581
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:28.200
Reggie: Oh no I never really like a brother and sister i'm doing i'm saying like it could be one.

582
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:30.000
Reggie: Oh man like.

583
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:41.310
Jessica Zaleski: So, so if you had a brother and a sister um everything about them could be identical exactly the same.

584
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.470
Reggie: I think we looked at facial features will look the same, but then everything else will be different.

585
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.420
Susan Snay: And you have to chime in.

586
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:56.190
Jessica Zaleski: For angie can you are you able to unmute I know you've had some microphone problems in the past, but can you say that for us angie.

587
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:08.010
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): I said that they can like the Meriden to cool cuz like I mean there are different genders, allowing don't the same the same.

588
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.760
Jessica Zaleski: I do tell them apart okay.

589
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:17.160
Sarah Michaels: If there are different gender would their 23rd chromosomes be identical.

590
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:21.780
Leandro Graterol: There was a question.

591
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:24.600
Jessica Zaleski: In Africa.

592
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:25.740
Sarah Michaels: If they're.

593
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.270
Sarah Michaels: identical twins or a boy and a girl.

594
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:39.960
Sarah Michaels: So if they're identical they have the same you know they're the same with their 23rd chromosome looks the same.

595
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:41.640
Anginellys Torres Bonilla (Student): No, no.

596
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.740
Jessica Zaleski: No, why not.

597
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:50.250
salam: Because different genders, a girl like you can tell a girl from a boy apart.

598
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.650
Sarah Michaels: But what about the 23rd chromosome.

599
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.640
salam: that's when it crumbles on for the girl it's um.

600
01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:07.200
salam: they're all the same size like they're straight for the boy there's one like one taller than the other, and for the girls X X and for the voice X, Y.

601
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.750
salam: Nowadays, be identical.

602
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:12.720
salam: know.

603
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:27.120
Jessica Zaleski: So let's talk about what that I identical means in connection with these chromosomes that we've been talking about so we just decided that, like we can't have identical.

604
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:39.990
Jessica Zaleski: twins that one is a boy and one is a girl So what does it mean to be an identical twin if we're thinking about everything we've been talking about with chromosomes.

605
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:44.790
Jessica Zaleski: If you're an identical twin like what does that mean for your chromosomes.

606
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:51.450
salam: I think it means like they have to be the same gender and they look alike.

607
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:55.830
Reggie: Well, the thing they have similar same amount of chromosomes.

608
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:57.600
Reggie: well.

609
01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.250
Sarah Michaels: Everyone more or less as.

610
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.560
Jessica Zaleski: I mean I reggie you're a human i'm a human.

611
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:01.830
Jessica Zaleski: I.

612
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.160
Jessica Zaleski: got much alike, but we both have the same number of chromosomes.

613
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:09.870
Sarah Michaels: Wait a second Uli you got to save this sick explain what you just rolling.

614
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.250
Jessica Zaleski: out Uli tell us.

615
01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:21.540
Jessica Zaleski: Can you unmute and tell us about Uli.

616
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:31.320
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, can you unmute and tell us what you just put in the chat That was really.

617
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.750
Susan Snay: Important found yes.

618
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.000
yulie: That they share the same DNA was.

619
01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.480
salam: Due to share their genes to share all their genes.

620
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:54.690
Jessica Zaleski: Well i'm going to ask you Leo about that again so Julie, you said they share the same DNA, do you know how that how that is possible.

621
01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.220
yulie: Well, from what I know that they come from the same leg and somehow they like.

622
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.800
yulie: I don't know what to say and like they.

623
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:09.600
yulie: They like going like I don't know to say it's hard for me to.

624
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.250
Jessica Zaleski: extend it in Spanish.

625
01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:12.810
yulie: Oh hey.

626
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:14.700
yulie: No.

627
01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.050
Reggie: Do you split.

628
01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:21.150
yulie: yeah like basically in the womb, and then they're like different people.

629
01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:31.230
Sarah Michaels: You mean that first cell that side goat which has all the DNA that person that sells splits.

630
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:32.370
yeah.

631
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:36.780
yulie: And that's how they become identical twins.

632
01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:39.750
Sarah Michaels: That is.

633
01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.040
Susan Snay: very profound.

634
01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.260
Jessica Zaleski: that's that's excellent.

635
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:46.950
Susan Snay: And, and you know we don't really know.

636
01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:51.750
Susan Snay: exactly why or how that happens.

637
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.870
Jessica Zaleski: And when mistake says we she doesn't just me and.

638
01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:55.410
Susan Snay: My God.

639
01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:02.490
Jessica Zaleski: We in this group, she means scientists through all time here don't exactly know how that happens.

640
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.320
Jessica Zaleski: yeah how.

641
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:25.680
Sarah Michaels: When we say that the zygote is the first baby cell and in identical twins that zygote splits and then they become you know the two there now to die, goats that have the same everything, and then they go on to grow in in the mother's womb.

642
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.980
Sarah Michaels: Is that what you're saying that Uli.

643
01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:38.130
salam: I think they're identical because, like it's going to be the same gender and they share all 13.

644
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:54.540
Jessica Zaleski: So let me ask you a question Uli so you said this psycho to get an idea to get identical twins this is, I go is going to split are divided in half and.

645
01:07:55.590 --> 01:08:12.840
Jessica Zaleski: Each of those halves will become its own person, but they share the exact same DNA now okay so she said yes so question, though, if this cell divides exactly like it is.

646
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.200
Susan Snay: You mean the one in the bottom of the.

647
01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:22.260
Jessica Zaleski: picture one in the bottom of the picture when it's just that that one combined sell.

648
01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.420
Jessica Zaleski: It does anything need to happen.

649
01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.670
Sarah Michaels: First, you could have floyd are deployed.

650
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.010
Sarah Michaels: wow.

651
01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:44.250
Susan Snay: What had to happen to mom's cell in order for her what had to happen to her chromosomes in order for her to.

652
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:49.710
produce perhaps Lloyd exile what happened to the chromosomes.

653
01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.490
Reggie: Again, what happened to moms chromosomes.

654
01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:11.670
Reggie: for her to be able to make that halfway Dag what I had to take place here, to take one chromosome from a pair and put them in.

655
01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.850
Reggie: The egg which transfers down to those deployed disciple Africa, I see that we.

656
01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.300
Reggie: Like as I, as I go.

657
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:28.050
Susan Snay: So if I just took one of moms one of each of her pairs would she have enough still.

658
01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.030
Reggie: No duplicates or make a copy yourself basically.

659
01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.580
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so let me ask you this question.

660
01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:37.770
Jessica Zaleski: When this news I go.

661
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:45.360
Jessica Zaleski: makes a copy, because we know that cells make copies of themselves right in our bodies, if I.

662
01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:46.230
Susan Snay: You know.

663
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:56.610
Jessica Zaleski: As I lose skin cells they're making copies Okay, when this cell makes a copy down here at the bottom, how many chromosomes will be in that copy.

664
01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.640
Reggie: The same amount as the original so beyond basically both have three pairs of two.

665
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:15.330
Sarah Michaels: So just doesn't divide in half, with three and one of the zygote and three and the other they both have both of the twins have six.

666
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.200
yeah.

667
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:19.860
Sarah Michaels: That makes sense yeah.

668
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:22.020
Sarah Michaels: Otherwise.

669
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:30.270
Jessica Zaleski: Your other kinds of twins other than identical who are twins that are born at the same time, but they don't look alike.

670
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.460
Reggie: isn't like fraternal.

671
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.770
Susan Snay: I think if we went back a few slides.

672
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.060
Jessica Zaleski: I was gonna say.

673
01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:45.090
Jessica Zaleski: let's talk about how this all started here way back at the beginning.

674
01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.860
Susan Snay: And look how far you guys have come you understand identical twins now.

675
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:59.640
Jessica Zaleski: Look at this the beginning yeah are Lucy and Maria identical, what do we think they're both female.

676
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.280
Jessica Zaleski: So can we say, do they look like they have.

677
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:07.230
Jessica Zaleski: The exact same DNA.

678
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.210
salam: I.

679
01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.580
Reggie: know they don't have this exact same DNA.

680
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:16.530
Susan Snay: Do you think they look at all like, do you think there any similarities between them.

681
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:18.120
salam: No, no.

682
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.890
No, no.

683
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:27.720
Jessica Zaleski: All right, i'm looking at the clock, it is 409 why don't we take a five minute break you guys are doing fantastic.

684
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:41.880
Jessica Zaleski: five minute break stretch grab something to drink come right back here for 14 and we'll have about 45 minutes to finish off our session for this evening okay so five minute break.

685
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.790
Sarah Michaels: This is the I was also thinking last night before I went to sleep, that if we wanted to do.

686
01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:03.270
Susan Snay: An example of a trait that you inherit without seeing the papers that they have in their kids.

687
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.130
Jessica Zaleski: I know I know.

688
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:05.880
Susan Snay: you like.

689
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:07.950
Jessica Zaleski: That would be too, but we could do that.

690
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.300
Jessica Zaleski: Tomorrow right, really, really.

691
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:10.800
Susan Snay: While we were yet.

692
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:20.430
Jessica Zaleski: So just i'm kind of looking at the time and realistically where we're going to go, I know i'm my concern is.

693
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:34.560
Jessica Zaleski: The model if we go into the breakout rooms to do the model thing that will take the rest of the time yeah I I really think that maybe we need to maybe do it together as quickly as possible and just.

694
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:47.700
Jessica Zaleski: do what we can, because I feel like it's really we will never solve the question if we don't get through the variation slides you know we're not going to get there for them, so I feel like that's really important.

695
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:55.110
Susan Snay: I think, as long as we do it do the activity, I don't think it will be too much of a loss of we do it together yeah.

696
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:55.590
Okay.

697
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:57.330
Okay.

698
01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:04.890
Anisha Hassan: um my mom had the superstition that have you ever seen conjoined bananas.

699
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:05.490
Sarah Michaels: Or the.

700
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:06.630
Anisha Hassan: twin banana.

701
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.130
Anisha Hassan: My mom had this.

702
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:12.060
Anisha Hassan: superstition that if you ate them will have twins.

703
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:17.340
Anisha Hassan: But my sister tried it she had lots of conjoined banana.

704
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.270
Susan Snay: bananas.

705
01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:28.860
Anisha Hassan: yeah, I think, maybe it's like very much local in Bangladesh, but like we used to get can join bananas, all the time.

706
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:32.160
Susan Snay: just talking about conjoined at the stem right.

707
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:35.070
Anisha Hassan: No it's just like side by side, I like it was a goo.

708
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.970
Jessica Zaleski: goo boys bananas.

709
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.600
Jessica Zaleski: Right now.

710
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.770
Raquel Fernandes: wow it's super interesting because they actually identical twins running my family.

711
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:55.680
Raquel Fernandes: My great grandparents, almost all of them were identical twins so my parents fingers something there.

712
01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.910
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yeah Well, this is why it's a mystery because.

713
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.360
Susan Snay: Very well, could be yeah neither basis yep.

714
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:11.160
Jessica Zaleski: And I mean they I think they understand more of the genetic basis for for identity for fraternal twins.

715
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:17.520
Jessica Zaleski: Right like hyper oscillation and things like that, but I mean right identical twins yeah.

716
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:19.590
Jessica Zaleski: So.

717
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.300
Susan Snay: Go grab my bag real quick.

718
01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:27.060
Jessica Zaleski: I am currently looking at conjoined bananas and they are fascinating.

719
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.640
Anisha Hassan: yeah I think in the.

720
01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.740
Anisha Hassan: end the season pick it got her.

721
01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:36.330
Anisha Hassan: yeah yeah I think in the US, because of production, they don't go into super my.

722
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:39.570
Jessica Zaleski: Mark yeah it's like those misfits market produce that.

723
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:45.180
Anisha Hassan: You can get misfit produce there's like a website.

724
01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:47.070
Anisha Hassan: yeah murder mystery produce.

725
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.560
Sarah Michaels: yo i've never seen one.

726
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:50.340
Sarah Michaels: That is.

727
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:55.140
Jessica Zaleski: So cool I mean it makes sense that it would happen, I mean.

728
01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:00.810
Anisha Hassan: yeah like I said, like I don't know if you guys seen eggs, with two yolks like that.

729
01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:02.310
Jessica Zaleski: Oh yes, yes.

730
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:03.960
Anisha Hassan: Because you have chickens.

731
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.680
Jessica Zaleski: No yeah.

732
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.240
Jessica Zaleski: My double strawberry.

733
01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:10.470
Susan Snay: Yes, yep.

734
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:13.710
salam: This is the two bananas in one.

735
01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.250
It is.

736
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:16.860
Jessica Zaleski: bananas in one.

737
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:22.200
Anisha Hassan: yeah but nobody got twins in my family, you have God.

738
01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.610
Jessica Zaleski: wow I never thought.

739
01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:32.700
Anisha Hassan: I was trying to tell my mom like the top possible because the babies on the forum like you can have it after that.

740
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.550
Susan Snay: eat it before you even get pregnant I don't know.

741
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:45.300
Anisha Hassan: I mean, I doubt.

742
01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:53.880
Susan Snay: Some of the things right that we we passed passed down through our.

743
01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:56.430
yeah.

744
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:09.900
Anisha Hassan: yeah I think my culture has so many weird superstition that I mean there's a black cat thing where if it crosses in front of you bad luck.

745
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.070
Jessica Zaleski: With that.

746
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:14.940
Susan Snay: Oh, look at that.

747
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:16.980
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, the can join banana.

748
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:19.050
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, there you go.

749
01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.540
Susan Snay: It almost looks like a star fruit.

750
01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.830
Susan Snay: yeah but it's a banana yeah that's cool.

751
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.350
Sarah Michaels: that's a great image.

752
01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.800
Sarah Michaels: I put a different image, right after the carrier type slide.

753
01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.150
Sarah Michaels: that's very cool.

754
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.060
Susan Snay: I suppose, they would take that out of the you know, out of the pile of bananas at the grocery.

755
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.940
Anisha Hassan: store yeah they wouldn't want to freak people out.

756
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.560
Anisha Hassan: Back home, no one really cares it's like yeah yeah it's a good luck you're gonna get.

757
01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:58.800
Susan Snay: double the diapers.

758
01:16:59.190 --> 01:16:59.520
yeah.

759
01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:10.680
Anisha Hassan: But I see my sister struggling with one BV I didn't think twins would cut it like.

760
01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.820
Jessica Zaleski: I don't know how people.

761
01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.100
yeah.

762
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:19.020
Jessica Zaleski: One at a time, is more than enough.

763
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.110
Susan Snay: reason why the majority of them are only one.

764
01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.120
twin sister.

765
01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:36.330
Anisha Hassan: yeah me too, I thought it would be so cool to have a twin.

766
01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.910
Anisha Hassan: There are these things yeah.

767
01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.980
Susan Snay: Things just like any sibling.

768
01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:46.290
salam: Miss I have a question.

769
01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:50.310
salam: How would the people that are triples.

770
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:53.310
Susan Snay: Oh there's another wouldn't be.

771
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:57.270
Susan Snay: fraternal triplets or identical triplets.

772
01:17:58.050 --> 01:17:59.430
salam: i'm identical.

773
01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:04.380
Jessica Zaleski: Or what do you think happens what happens for identical twins what did we just say.

774
01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.930
salam: They shared their genes and DNA.

775
01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: yeah, how is that formed what happens to the zygote.

776
01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:11.640
um.

777
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:14.910
Jessica Zaleski: What did you Lisa.

778
01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.050
Jessica Zaleski: Combined means put together.

779
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:20.580
Reggie: So it's.

780
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.140
salam: eggs splits.

781
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:33.210
Jessica Zaleski: Not the egg the zygote right that what what's formed by the that splits so if it splits into two to get twins what is it split into to get triplets.

782
01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:35.400
Jessica Zaleski: Ray Ray.

783
01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.660
Reggie: We miss.

784
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.390
Jessica Zaleski: split into four or five.

785
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:43.410
Susan Snay: People.

786
01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:54.600
Reggie: amber watch the movie was called sex tablets I know your was until I found out that she like it means like yes six arm like Leslie was caught on.

787
01:18:55.410 --> 01:19:00.390
Reggie: identical twins yeah six babies born at the same time.

788
01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.200
Reggie: that's the.

789
01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.840
salam: that's the module like a lot.

790
01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:12.210
Jessica Zaleski: Better if it's identical it's definitely a natural I mean today you have a lot of multiples that are the result of IBM.

791
01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:16.920
Jessica Zaleski: yeah but they'll they won't be for they'll be fraternal they won't be identical.

792
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:20.130
Jessica Zaleski: But that's why multiples are so much more common now.

793
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:34.710
Jessica Zaleski: yeah we should get started again here because we've got so much to get through, hopefully everybody's back i'm going to present my screen again we talked about this and you guys came up with.

794
01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:53.340
Jessica Zaleski: some excellent explanations that if that sperm had 46 chromosomes that human sperm had 46 instead of 23 if it was deployed instead of half boyd and the egg had 46 chromosomes instead of half.

795
01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.210
Jessica Zaleski: That baby that offspring.

796
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.470
Jessica Zaleski: would have 92 and.

797
01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:02.430
Susan Snay: That is.

798
01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:23.640
Jessica Zaleski: not going to be a human baby Okay, we talked about the the impact that just one additional chromosome makes Okay, resulting in a person with down syndrome, can you imagine twice the number of chromosomes that you're supposed to have that just wouldn't work it wouldn't be viable.

799
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:34.020
Susan Snay: But every one of these chromosomes in a human is going to be different information than a chromosome on a mosquito or in a goldfish.

800
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:46.500
Jessica Zaleski: So the information is completely different also yeah it doesn't mean that you would give birth to a different organism, I mean you can't a human can't make a different organism a human is going to produce.

801
01:20:47.040 --> 01:21:14.790
Jessica Zaleski: Either a viable baby with 46 chromosomes or a viable baby with maybe some extra chromosome information, but some abnormalities because the normal is 46 anything that's different than 46 chromosomes for human is abnormal and is usually going to have some sort of health issues.

802
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:17.970
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so yeah.

803
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.570
salam: I have a question about like a fish.

804
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:30.960
salam: If i'm she gives birth, not just one at gets out as multiple sources are they twins like all of them I don't know.

805
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:44.370
Susan Snay: We don't really use twins like with fish because they're all born at the same time, so I mean technically I guess you could say that they're all twins but they're just we just say offspring.

806
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.100
salam: That was yeah.

807
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.020
Susan Snay: That large group offspring.

808
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.550
Susan Snay: yeah.

809
01:21:50.640 --> 01:22:13.860
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so this is where we want, we want everybody participating in this and we are going to try to quickly combine all of these ideas that in these rules for how to make a viable offspring How does that genetic information get from the mom and the dad.

810
01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:27.660
Jessica Zaleski: into the baby, we want you to think about the activity we did on the slide deck the mom and the dad and then that information passed through something to get to the baby.

811
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:42.390
Jessica Zaleski: And we want to talk about like what were the rules when we made those babies last week in those breakout rooms, what did we have to what did we start with How did we begin now.

812
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.570
Jessica Zaleski: Well i'm tell us one thing.

813
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:51.150
salam: We started with like flipping the coin, because it picks random the chromosomes.

814
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:53.790
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

815
01:22:55.230 --> 01:23:00.750
Jessica Zaleski: Think think about on the page What did you see at the top, where did we start with.

816
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.190
salam: mom and dad.

817
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:15.750
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so we start with them, we start with a mother and a father Okay, and then somebody else think back to that slide we have the mom and the dad and then kind of below the mom and the dad what did we have on that slide.

818
01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.780
Nhi Huynh: chromosomes of the mom and the dad.

819
01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.840
Jessica Zaleski: yeah inside the mom and the dad, we could see their.

820
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.140
Jessica Zaleski: chromosomes okay so i'm just going to kind of write this down so.

821
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:28.320
Jessica Zaleski: The male and.

822
01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.370
Female.

823
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:31.320
Jessica Zaleski: Have.

824
01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:36.990
Jessica Zaleski: How many chromosomes did they have in in now.

825
01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:37.770
Susan Snay: yeah what do we.

826
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:37.950
Do.

827
01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:41.340
Susan Snay: But what if it's not a human.

828
01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:41.730
yeah.

829
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.040
Susan Snay: What do we call that number.

830
01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.050
Reggie: deployed.

831
01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:51.480
Jessica Zaleski: whoa deployed Okay, have you diploid cells.

832
01:23:51.510 --> 01:24:03.030
Jessica Zaleski: With and we don't know it could be any organ and we don't know it's just the correct number of chromosomes for that organism right that were deployed, then we can talk about.

833
01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:04.860
Susan Snay: Any species.

834
01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:20.940
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we've got that male and female in our activity, it was six for the male and six for the female and then, as we moved from there, towards the Center of the page what was what was just below the male and below the female.

835
01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.830
Reggie: On the egg and sperm yeah.

836
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:36.540
Jessica Zaleski: And what was that special word we used to describe those egg and sperm because, again we wouldn't necessarily say that, like plants have sperm and egg but what do they make what was that term.

837
01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:43.380
Reggie: The reproductive one or the um I forgot the signal was it was like fertilization.

838
01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:46.380
Sarah Michaels: Well, we haven't gotten to fertilization.

839
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:47.100
Sarah Michaels: Quite yet.

840
01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:50.190
salam: Does it start with dizzy nope.

841
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:51.690
Jessica Zaleski: It starts with a g.

842
01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:55.350
Reggie: starts with a G guy me.

843
01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:15.480
Jessica Zaleski: I mean yeah jammies OK, so the male the male and female produce or make Gani sell gametes Okay, and what did we learn about those gametes what was special about those game, I need to.

844
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.960
Reggie: describe the chromosomes and again they have deployed, I think it was it was called but employees.

845
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.480
Susan Snay: wow look at that to.

846
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:28.410
salam: Really complex terms gabby and halfway.

847
01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:30.120
Jessica Zaleski: You don't have to copy this no.

848
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:41.460
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, just focus on what we're typing here and see where we're going next OK, so the male and female produce gametes that are half Lloyd so half yes.

849
01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:43.920
Leandro Graterol: I we doing this together we're.

850
01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:53.610
Jessica Zaleski: All talking together and i'm typing exactly okay so we're thinking through that process so we've got the male and the female they have their diploid cells, whatever it is for that.

851
01:25:54.090 --> 01:26:04.740
Jessica Zaleski: The male and the female produce these gametes sperm and egg in some organisms that have half the number of cells, well then, what did we do next.

852
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.990
salam: Then we'll go to the word that starts with the F I don't know how to really say it, maybe somebody else can say it now.

853
01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:22.890
Reggie: They combined into the arms I forgot what it was called Z.

854
01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.340
Keyshawn: I do.

855
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:30.900
Jessica Zaleski: Too yep Oh, I say somebody said psycho.

856
01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:32.670
Keyshawn: But then I heard a guy go.

857
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:36.090
Leandro Graterol: Like something that begins to the picture yeah yeah.

858
01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:41.250
Ms. B: Sean zygote wow What did you say the word that begins with an F.

859
01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:44.370
Jessica Zaleski: To.

860
01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:46.950
Jessica Zaleski: Just type fertilization.

861
01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.410
Ms. B: or delay yeah yeah was that the word.

862
01:26:49.650 --> 01:26:50.700
Susan Snay: realized yep.

863
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.780
salam: Thank you miss.

864
01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.100
Ms. B: you're welcome.

865
01:26:53.220 --> 01:27:04.380
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so what is fertilization let's talk about that mistakes that it was a process so fertilization okay occurs when what what what happens.

866
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.380
Reggie: except when the sperm.

867
01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:09.090
Leandro Graterol: know and.

868
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:17.040
Jessica Zaleski: let's try to use the terms that are already in our rules here are we are we using sperm and egg right now.

869
01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.210
Susan Snay: What if they're not egg and sperm, what if their plants.

870
01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:23.490
Reggie: When the.

871
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:27.150
Reggie: game made some what's god's combine.

872
01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:32.610
Sarah Michaels: Quick somebody else say what they think read you just said.

873
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.890
salam: And if you didn't know that again the spearmint combined.

874
01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:47.940
Sarah Michaels: that's not quite and if you can't remember what reggie said asked him to repeat it, but listen really closely.

875
01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:50.280
salam: read you can you please hit it.

876
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.250
Reggie: When the game meets combined.

877
01:27:54.510 --> 01:28:00.270
Sarah Michaels: So we'll get who can say that you can put that idea fertilization occurs when.

878
01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:14.550
Ms. B: So so you're on the right track, you just have to use the word that means the egg and the sperm combining So what is that word what what was the word that reggie was using for when the egg in the sperm combine.

879
01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.200
Leandro Graterol: The again.

880
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.880
Ms. B: The gimme and then that they are doing what what's that word that you said.

881
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.340
salam: drizzle light.

882
01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:24.450
Jessica Zaleski: station.

883
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:29.250
Ms. B: And when they become fertilized what do they make what is that baby called.

884
01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.680
Ms. B: it's with a Z word what's that Z word.

885
01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:35.940
Susan Snay: don said it.

886
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.700
Ms. B: so good at it very good group.

887
01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.100
Jessica Zaleski: Great great.

888
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:57.750
Jessica Zaleski: So fertilization occurs when gametes combine to form as I got zygote and what do we know think back to the activity What is different about that zygote from those gametes.

889
01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:03.240
Jessica Zaleski: We said the gametes are half Lloyd, what is the zygote.

890
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:04.980
deploy.

891
01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:08.580
Sarah Michaels: put it in the whole sentence say.

892
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:09.720
Sarah Michaels: yeah it is.

893
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:11.730
Keyshawn: Multiple chromosomes.

894
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:13.590
Jessica Zaleski: Okay.

895
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:16.920
Jessica Zaleski: Does the number matter key Sean.

896
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:18.660
Keyshawn: Yes.

897
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.680
Okay.

898
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.530
Jessica Zaleski: let's see if we can combine those if.

899
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:31.650
Reggie: they're gonna they're gonna take i'm like both of those deploys from the egg and or the egg and sperm time by human nature combined them and so typically.

900
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:33.060
Reggie: What does.

901
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.350
Susan Snay: It actually mean.

902
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:35.280
To.

903
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:40.380
Sarah Michaels: deployed so would be.

904
01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:43.890
salam: I have one on.

905
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.550
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so fertilization occurs when gametes combine to form as I go.

906
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.940
Sarah Michaels: We want to say, as I go, which is.

907
01:29:57.330 --> 01:29:58.350
Jessica Zaleski: What is this I go.

908
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.920
Susan Snay: I go in terms of chromosome number.

909
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:02.850
Is what.

910
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:10.980
Reggie: keeps you there again.

911
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.880
Jessica Zaleski: So can anybody complete sentence here the zygote.

912
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.670
Jessica Zaleski: Is let's think about in terms of chromosomes.

913
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.320
salam: copy so that chrome fans are combined.

914
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.500
Susan Snay: Oh, you are so maybe we could add a little bit more to that.

915
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.570
Reggie: yeah is double.

916
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:32.970
Reggie: The amount of chromosomes that.

917
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.820
Reggie: Was cons hot friggin new ones have Lloyd has.

918
01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:41.400
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so let's let's go with that so.

919
01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:46.260
Jessica Zaleski: The zygote you said is what do we call it if it's double what does that term.

920
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:58.890
Jessica Zaleski: deployed OK, so the zygote is deployed why, why is it deployed think of what anybody can repeat what Salaam just said, why is it deployed what happened.

921
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.090
Reggie: They combined what combined.

922
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:05.310
Reggie: The two athletes.

923
01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:15.090
Jessica Zaleski: Because the chromosomes.

924
01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:17.760
Jessica Zaleski: From what.

925
01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:21.450
What made the zygote.

926
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.940
salam: The egg indiscriminate.

927
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:27.240
Jessica Zaleski: yeah and what word, are we using to describe the egg in the sperm.

928
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:28.890
salam: Brazil, I.

929
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.050
Jessica Zaleski: Know that's the process.

930
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:32.760
Sarah Michaels: knee wrote.

931
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.240
Sarah Michaels: In the.

932
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.100
Jessica Zaleski: gametes good nice so as I go to simply because the chromosomes.

933
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.520
Jessica Zaleski: In the gametes.

934
01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:45.870
Sarah Michaels: bind yeah.

935
01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:53.580
Sarah Michaels: And Nikki actually used a different word to she said fuse yeah did you write.

936
01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:58.230
Jessica Zaleski: oops sorry.

937
01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.210
Go back.

938
01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:08.280
Jessica Zaleski: Here Okay, because the chromosomes in a gametes, we can say combine yeah okay.

939
01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:15.780
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so now we've kind of gone through our rules, what we want to do is go over to our initial ideas.

940
01:32:16.050 --> 01:32:26.280
Jessica Zaleski: And just clear up any questions, I think that maybe our rules, help to explain and answer some of these questions, but we just want to make sure okay so.

941
01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:44.400
Jessica Zaleski: The first initial idea you guys came up way back at the beginning, like in session one or session to actually was there's an egg from the mother and we had a question what is that egg called what is that special term we're going to use to describe the egg.

942
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:52.650
Susan Snay: Can I just ask real quick before it is this big enough for everybody to see, can you all see this.

943
01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.360
Reggie: The one yes.

944
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.460
Okay, maybe it's just me.

945
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:02.820
Jessica Zaleski: Because i'm typing In it I can't make it better than us.

946
01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:05.880
Keyshawn: Danny.

947
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:21.240
Jessica Zaleski: Danny very good key shawn so that egg from the mom is called the Gani Okay, and over here, it says that females produce gametes yeah awesome and then number two there's a sperm from the father what's this called.

948
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:22.860
Reggie: Give me.

949
01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:24.180
Jessica Zaleski: can't get it.

950
01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:29.400
Jessica Zaleski: we've got it so i'm going to kind of i'm just going to kind of cross these out well.

951
01:33:29.970 --> 01:33:32.400
Susan Snay: This is where we're modifying our model.

952
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:34.530
salam: tearing it down.

953
01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:40.740
Jessica Zaleski: I can't cross these out right now, because everything else is so tiny but that's okay we've got these okay.

954
01:33:41.760 --> 01:34:02.190
Jessica Zaleski: um alright offspring get some physical traits and characteristics from father and some from mother can anybody explain like where look at number three offspring get some physical traits and characteristics from father and some from the mother How does that happen.

955
01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.100
salam: From the chromosomes let me do an activity that.

956
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:12.780
Susan Snay: showed us, maybe, how you get some physical traits and not others.

957
01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.340
Jessica Zaleski: yeah What did we do in the process.

958
01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:21.930
Jessica Zaleski: When we were making babies.

959
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:22.830
Jessica Zaleski: say it again.

960
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.060
salam: flip the coin, they get picked random.

961
01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:33.420
Jessica Zaleski: So maybe we need to add that over there in the Rules right yeah okay.

962
01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:46.620
Jessica Zaleski: So the male and female produce these gametes that are half Lloyd um and How did we decide which chromosomes went from the mom and the dad into their sperm and egg.

963
01:34:47.010 --> 01:34:49.230
Reggie: If the coin, the coin and.

964
01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.270
Jessica Zaleski: Random okay.

965
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.770
Jessica Zaleski: and

966
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:56.370
salam: Then, after one is done this is how we know it's a female or male.

967
01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:06.450
Jessica Zaleski: Now, with it just let me ask you a question, we had six chromosomes and that will talk about the the dad for a second right six chromosomes.

968
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:19.920
Jessica Zaleski: When we flip that coin could we pick any of those sex chromosomes three times to move into that egg who we move any one we wanted.

969
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.210
salam: No it's fixed random, but the coin so heads or tails.

970
01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:29.940
salam: So Okay, I guess heads was for the dad be, and it was was for.

971
01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:42.540
Jessica Zaleski: Everybody look at the screen for a minute Okay, I see cameras on but I don't even see people looking at it, I just want to make sure everybody's looking here, so what i'm asking is if I go over to mom right now okay.

972
01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:57.180
Jessica Zaleski: And I say okay I gotta get three chromosomes into the egg i'm going to copy um let's see i'm going to copy this one, why can I oh I probably can't copy because i'm.

973
01:35:58.650 --> 01:36:03.210
Jessica Zaleski: Let me see Oh, here we go all right i'm going to copy this one.

974
01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.230
Jessica Zaleski: Here we go and.

975
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:08.070
salam: Then i'm going to.

976
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.840
Jessica Zaleski: Be this one.

977
01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:13.470
Oh.

978
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:15.420
Is that.

979
01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.500
Jessica Zaleski: Then i'm going to copy.

980
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:23.010
Jessica Zaleski: This one can I do that.

981
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:25.230
salam: No from each pair you gotta take one.

982
01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:31.170
Jessica Zaleski: hey Can somebody else say what Salaam just said.

983
01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.070
Reggie: Islam keisha again.

984
01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.100
salam: Each pair she gotta take one only.

985
01:36:40.230 --> 01:36:43.110
salam: And decided random you cannot decide which one it is.

986
01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.600
Jessica Zaleski: Can somebody else say that in their own words.

987
01:36:53.640 --> 01:37:00.750
Reggie: what's called they said that um they've gone they picked randomly like you can't choose which ones to go inside of it, what is.

988
01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:03.300
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, well, I picked randomly reggie.

989
01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:16.290
Sarah Michaels: Sabina I think you're going to try, so we got the random but but but can you just pick anyone randomly or say say it again what I think Salam said.

990
01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:18.930
salam: Do I say it again together.

991
01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:21.690
Sarah Michaels: Like I want, I want to see if Sabina can do it.

992
01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.580
Sarah Michaels: off, we can forcing.

993
01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:30.990
Sarah Michaels: Somebody else somebody else come on.

994
01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:32.130
Jessica Zaleski: What is the row.

995
01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:41.580
Susan Snay: Can you pick just any any chromosomes to double.

996
01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.410
Reggie: What did you say.

997
01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:54.900
Jessica Zaleski: Can I just pick whatever three of whichever ones, I want to move over here i'm going to pick.

998
01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.700
Reggie: One from each pair.

999
01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.240
Oh.

1000
01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.960
Jessica Zaleski: So let's put those two ideas together.

1001
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:18.000
Jessica Zaleski: Everybody was talking about how I don't get to pick which one, but it has to be one from each pair so let's go back here to our rules, because this is a really important part of the rules and.

1002
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:25.680
Susan Snay: Most of it in your initial ideas that you actually came up with a while back, we just need to add a little bit more to it.

1003
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.930
Jessica Zaleski: OK, so the chromosomes.

1004
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:38.430
Jessica Zaleski: In the gametes How are they picked.

1005
01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:41.220
Random random.

1006
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.450
Jessica Zaleski: are picked randomly but are they total is it totally random.

1007
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:51.090
Reggie: No it's each pair.

1008
01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:58.170
Jessica Zaleski: With one from each hair.

1009
01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:07.560
salam: It cannot be random and like to pick from like, for example, from one pair i'm a PIC both of them and put them in like in there, I cannot do that.

1010
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:18.510
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so if you were following these rules, you think you would know what to do the chromosomes in the gametes are picked randomly with one from each pair does that make sense.

1011
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:20.130
salam: yeah yeah.

1012
01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:31.800
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we just that explains how those offspring get some traits from your father and some from their mother me and.

1013
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:34.290
Jessica Zaleski: i'm.

1014
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:42.090
Jessica Zaleski: Not oh look at number six not offspring, not all offspring get the same traits, why did they not all get the same traits.

1015
01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:43.410
Reggie: Because it's picking randomly.

1016
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:49.620
Susan Snay: So we can answer these questions, you came up with an initial ideas with the rules, you just made.

1017
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.320
salam: But miss with this it couldn't hear you.

1018
01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:02.760
Susan Snay: Are we able to use the rules that were that you just created you wrote to answer that question.

1019
01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.740
Leandro Graterol: yeah yeah.

1020
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:15.900
Susan Snay: that's exactly what this is supposed to be if we gave these rules to students that have not done this before they should be able to use them to help them answer questions like that.

1021
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:31.560
Jessica Zaleski: This is me, I want to just look at number four before we move on to the next thing it says that genes are passed from parents to offspring through chromosomes Where are those chromosomes where did we say the chromosomes are located.

1022
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:32.910
Reggie: In the nucleus.

1023
01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.740
Jessica Zaleski: nucleus and.

1024
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:37.710
Jessica Zaleski: The nucleus, and what our chromosomes.

1025
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:39.930
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly.

1026
01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:44.790
salam: um.

1027
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:49.290
Susan Snay: I think line in ourselves.

1028
01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.390
salam: know, there was like black and white.

1029
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.660
salam: black and white and.

1030
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:56.910
salam: they're not the same shape.

1031
01:40:57.450 --> 01:41:09.900
Jessica Zaleski: Remember that video that we watched and it showed those chromosomes floating around and then it showed the chromosomes kind of unraveling into this long chain what was that chain.

1032
01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.160
DNA.

1033
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.730
Jessica Zaleski: DNA So what are chromosomes.

1034
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:17.190
Leandro Graterol: Do you need yeah.

1035
01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:22.770
Jessica Zaleski: exactly right, so I think, maybe we want to just um let's see.

1036
01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:29.940
Jessica Zaleski: Do we want to add that in do you think it's important to say where the chromosomes are and what they are.

1037
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:32.250
salam: yeah as part of the rule I.

1038
01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:33.210
Jessica Zaleski: guess okay.

1039
01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:36.900
salam: that's how how we cannot make it without the from the songs.

1040
01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:48.870
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, because remember look at the question we're answering How does genetic information get passed from parents to offspring, so you just told me that chromosomes.

1041
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:53.280
Jessica Zaleski: Are what what are they again.

1042
01:41:54.540 --> 01:42:01.920
Jessica Zaleski: Almost homes are made of DNA and they are where are they located.

1043
01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:04.890
salam: In the nucleus and.

1044
01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:06.570
Jessica Zaleski: The nucleus of what.

1045
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:08.100
salam: A cell.

1046
01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:10.260
salam: The nucleus is it so.

1047
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:14.610
Susan Snay: Is the nucleus, a cell for the nucleus.

1048
01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.340
Reggie: In the so.

1049
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.680
Jessica Zaleski: The nucleus of the cell okay.

1050
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:22.110
Jessica Zaleski: I mean this.

1051
01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:37.020
Jessica Zaleski: is fantastic you guys did an awesome job I think you know there's some things initial ideas questions that you guys had in thoughts that you guys had that we didn't really get to i'm looking at like number six.

1052
01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:46.230
Jessica Zaleski: Well, no, number seven some genes are more dominant or stronger than others do we know how to explain that have we talked about that yet.

1053
01:42:47.550 --> 01:43:05.490
Jessica Zaleski: I see Edwin shaking his head like yeah we didn't really cover that we will eventually in biology class but that's still a question that we have that this model doesn't explain, but if somebody asked you, how does the genetic information get from parents to offspring look at these rules.

1054
01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:18.090
Jessica Zaleski: These are the rules that explained think back to the beginning when a lot of you thought that the genetic information got passed through the blood is there anything about blood in here.

1055
01:43:19.650 --> 01:43:21.120
salam: Oh Look how far you gave me.

1056
01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:40.500
Jessica Zaleski: You guys should be super proud of yourselves like this is amazing that your initial ideas going through this process, you came up with all these rules and can explain exactly how this happens, this is a complex question yeah things we can't see that that.

1057
01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.630
Susan Snay: That you all worked through.

1058
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:56.790
Jessica Zaleski: And I have been wanting to share this i'm going to stop sharing for one second so you guys can see me, because this is mind blowing so when we're talking about egg and sperm, can you see an egg a human egg with your eyes.

1059
01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:58.290
salam: No, no.

1060
01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.260
Jessica Zaleski: How many cells is a human egg.

1061
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:07.740
Jessica Zaleski: This isn't a trick question how many cells and a human egg.

1062
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:27.720
Jessica Zaleski: 101 Sally exactly we talked about how egg cells are single cells and sperm cells are single cells Okay, with a nucleus, with all that genetic information inside look at what I have in my hands here, what is this.

1063
01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:29.730
Reggie: an egg.

1064
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:33.330
Jessica Zaleski: Egg from my chickens in my yard days, I have to add.

1065
01:44:33.330 --> 01:44:35.490
Jessica Zaleski: Chickens that lay blue and green eggs.

1066
01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:36.030
Susan Snay: Are eggs.

1067
01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:37.440
Now.

1068
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:51.840
Jessica Zaleski: This egg if it was combined with if I had a rooster, which is a male chicken, which I do not Okay, but if it was combined what would I get.

1069
01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:53.220
A check.

1070
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.470
Jessica Zaleski: So.

1071
01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:01.410
Susan Snay: The term we use when that egg would combine with the male self.

1072
01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:02.340
Wait.

1073
01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.580
Sarah Michaels: Is that egg again me.

1074
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:07.680
Jessica Zaleski: Is this again me.

1075
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.510
Reggie: No.

1076
01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:10.170
No.

1077
01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:17.370
Reggie: It is simply I was caught or Fo Scott oh.

1078
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:19.290
Jessica Zaleski: As I go Is that what you mean.

1079
01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:20.760
Reggie: yeah.

1080
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:23.310
Jessica Zaleski: Is there is there a baby chicken here.

1081
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:24.960
Reggie: No, no, no.

1082
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.920
Jessica Zaleski: Why isn't a baby chicken, what did I tell you about the chickens that I have at my house.

1083
01:45:32.490 --> 01:45:34.920
salam: Because there's no a male.

1084
01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:52.350
Jessica Zaleski: me there's no there's no mail, so I would need a male and kesha just said, this is a grammy this is look at how big it is, I mean this is crazy, this is a grammy for a chicken not.

1085
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:54.780
Jessica Zaleski: Just this.

1086
01:45:55.170 --> 01:45:56.580
Jessica Zaleski: One why.

1087
01:45:57.780 --> 01:45:58.860
that's a big sell.

1088
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:02.880
Susan Snay: A lot bigger than a human excel right.

1089
01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.940
Sarah Michaels: Is it half load or deploy whoo.

1090
01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:08.640
Jessica Zaleski: How do you think.

1091
01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:10.710
Jessica Zaleski: Absolutely why.

1092
01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.840
salam: Because deployed is too.

1093
01:46:15.150 --> 01:46:17.550
Jessica Zaleski: Can this ever make a check by itself.

1094
01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.480
salam: No, no.

1095
01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.180
salam: Because there's no mail.

1096
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:31.680
Jessica Zaleski: doesn't have any DNA from the mail in it it's only got the DNA from the chicken from the hand it doesn't have any DNA from the rooster because I don't have any roosters.

1097
01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:43.080
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so I just you know we were talking about this last week, how it's so crazy like we're talking about these microscopic eggs, but in reality, you guys all have experience with.

1098
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:54.660
Jessica Zaleski: chicken eggs or other duck eggs or you know, if you like, to eat eggs, whatever type of eggs, I mean miss miss Kay was talking about ostrich eggs, have you ever seen an ostrich egg egg is this big it's.

1099
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:58.410
Susan Snay: it's bigger than a softball about two times the size of a softball.

1100
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.740
Jessica Zaleski: don't miss the size of a football and.

1101
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.860
Jessica Zaleski: Football one cell.

1102
01:47:05.370 --> 01:47:06.150
Leandro Graterol: How is that big.

1103
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:08.340
Jessica Zaleski: Well, ostrich is a very.

1104
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.640
Susan Snay: Big bird and Austin is a very large bird.

1105
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.860
Susan Snay: But yeah.

1106
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:16.740
Susan Snay: there's no male ostrich it's still.

1107
01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:24.090
Susan Snay: The female egg so one the big one, but it's one one.

1108
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:38.640
Jessica Zaleski: All right, wow you guys are doing great alright, I just want to let me share again here I am and because that that's just mind blowing to me I don't think about that you don't think about it when you're cracking an egg open but.

1109
01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:44.700
Susan Snay: Has anybody ever cracked an egg open and saw a developing chicken side.

1110
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.770
salam: No.

1111
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:49.260
Anisha Hassan: yeah I was very traumatized.

1112
01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:59.820
Susan Snay: Yes, yeah yeah when I used to get my eggs from the farm in maine there was a rooster that was on the farm, so what what was I cracking open.

1113
01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:01.350
salam: A chick.

1114
01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:05.460
Susan Snay: And what would you what would you how would you describe the chromosomes in that chick.

1115
01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:06.900
salam: there's a.

1116
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:12.120
salam: Was it goes, is it started with the letter g.

1117
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:13.650
Jessica Zaleski: What it is.

1118
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.030
Susan Snay: yeah oh.

1119
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:22.200
Jessica Zaleski: Yes, I go yep chromosomes would that cell be half the number of chromosomes are the full number of chromosomes.

1120
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:24.450
Jessica Zaleski: And what do we call that.

1121
01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.350
Reggie: A deploy.

1122
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.160
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, you guys are.

1123
01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:27.930
Jessica Zaleski: Killing it.

1124
01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:36.930
Jessica Zaleski: All right, let's go back to our presentation and bring it back to Lucy and Maria for a minute, because that was the question that we were trying to answer at the start of all this.

1125
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:54.810
Jessica Zaleski: So let's just take a look really quickly and use our model to see how specific gametes might have formed to produce Lucy and Maria okay so remember that when we talked about Lucy and Maria we talked about how their their dad.

1126
01:48:55.830 --> 01:49:04.410
Jessica Zaleski: His mother and his father, so the mother is going to be a and the father is going to be be we're both northern European okay.

1127
01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:07.110
Susan Snay: So that would be Lucy and maria's grandmother.

1128
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:16.140
Jessica Zaleski: And exactly Lucy and maria's grandmother and grandfather on their dad side they're both from northern Europe okay they're both Caucasian.

1129
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:32.790
Jessica Zaleski: Now her yeah light skin her mother's mother, which we're going to use a prime because we're going to keep track of that is Jamaican and her mother's Father be prime is northern European.

1130
01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:35.880
hi.

1131
01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:46.800
Jessica Zaleski: So do you think the chromosomes that they got from their dad explain the differences between the twins look at the chromosomes they got from their dad.

1132
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:50.070
Susan Snay: What did dad have to give.

1133
01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.680
Jessica Zaleski: What did he have to give what type if we're thinking about like skin color and physical characteristics.

1134
01:49:58.290 --> 01:50:00.060
Jessica Zaleski: Both of his parents were what.

1135
01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.960
salam: i'm know there are p.

1136
01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:08.760
Jessica Zaleski: Northern European so so would that explain why the twins look so different.

1137
01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:11.310
Nhi Huynh: yeah.

1138
01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:26.610
Jessica Zaleski: Well i'm all that let's look at the question again, do you think the chromosomes that the twins got from their dad explain the differences what's the only kind of chromosomes that they could have gotten from their dad.

1139
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:27.570
amb.

1140
01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:32.280
Jessica Zaleski: Well, they got an A and B and when what are dad's chromosomes look like.

1141
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:35.310
Jessica Zaleski: What What is his ancestry.

1142
01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.170
Susan Snay: color of skin in the.

1143
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:38.520
Keyshawn: dads gender.

1144
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:40.080
Reggie: Caucasian.

1145
01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:41.640
Jessica Zaleski: Okay, so location.

1146
01:50:42.090 --> 01:50:44.730
Susan Snay: yeah so what What would you how would you describe Caucasian.

1147
01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:50.340
salam: Miss asking like what skin color does yeah yes.

1148
01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:51.210
Yes, why.

1149
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:53.670
Jessica Zaleski: White okay.

1150
01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:54.270
salam: Yes, yeah.

1151
01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:06.420
Jessica Zaleski: yeah it only has white light skinned sounds like sounds NUTS oh sorry genes, to give right that's what he got from his mom and that's what he got from his dad.

1152
01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:07.110
You have.

1153
01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:27.210
Jessica Zaleski: Nothing else to go so probably not because his parents are northern European so the traits that are associated with ethnicity on the a chromosome and the B are going to be similar he only has that type, to give but.

1154
01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:44.910
Jessica Zaleski: So, if we look at that that doesn't really account for it, if we take a look at mom and we look at the possible combinations that mom could create we're going to go a little quickly through this here because of time, but let's take a look all right.

1155
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:50.520
Jessica Zaleski: Well i'm going to actually escape from here, look at the different possible combinations.

1156
01:51:50.850 --> 01:51:58.350
Susan Snay: Remember, this is when we were doing that activity we were flipping a coin deciding randomly which one the gimme would receive.

1157
01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:04.500
Jessica Zaleski: And remember don't get confused, we know that Lucy and Maria do not have.

1158
01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:16.800
Jessica Zaleski: Three pairs of chromosomes okay we're only using this to represent it, because if we had to have 23 pairs it wouldn't fit on the screen right so we're looking at just.

1159
01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:26.400
Jessica Zaleski: Only three of them only three pairs look at the different combinations here it's a little hard to see, but we have a one a prime two way prime three prime.

1160
01:52:26.970 --> 01:52:38.580
Jessica Zaleski: One be prime to be prime three prime one a prime to be pot prime three I could go on and on and read all the different if we sat there and flipped the coin.

1161
01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:55.860
Jessica Zaleski: Every time and they different combinations for the gametes that their mom could produce those eggs that their mom there would be this many different combinations okay so eight different combinations eight different combinations.

1162
01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:56.190
Day.

1163
01:52:57.270 --> 01:53:00.090
Sarah Michaels: and her mom was.

1164
01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.930
Jessica Zaleski: My mother is Jamaican.

1165
01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.540
Sarah Michaels: Nathan, and her father was white.

1166
01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:30.540
Jessica Zaleski: So let's take a look at this for a second if moms mother mom's mother is a prime her father is be prime her mother is Jamaican what would some pot, what would a possible combination be again a combination of chromosomes in this exile that went on to be Lucy.

1167
01:53:31.650 --> 01:53:37.500
Jessica Zaleski: Lucy had the red hair and the fair skin what could she have gotten maybe.

1168
01:53:38.670 --> 01:53:42.450
Jessica Zaleski: Would she have gotten the a PRIMES or the be PRIMES.

1169
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:46.140
Nhi Nguyen (Student): Lucy.

1170
01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.830
Jessica Zaleski: So a is megan.

1171
01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:51.720
Reggie: Be which one was Lucy again.

1172
01:53:51.810 --> 01:53:54.630
Jessica Zaleski: Lucy had the red hair and the very fair pals again.

1173
01:53:55.110 --> 01:53:55.800
salam: you've got me.

1174
01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.440
salam: What miss with the straight hair right.

1175
01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.240
Jessica Zaleski: yeah with the straight hair yeah.

1176
01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:10.410
Jessica Zaleski: yeah Lucy had to get the bees, because Lucy looks very Caucasian.

1177
01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.200
Susan Snay: Light skin red hair.

1178
01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:18.780
Jessica Zaleski: and which egg might have been maria's which chromosomes.

1179
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:20.970
Jessica Zaleski: A heaven and Maria zag.

1180
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:22.380
Reggie: Which one got the a.

1181
01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:49.620
Jessica Zaleski: He has a has those traits from maria's mother, who is Jamaican that's that half of maria's mother's DNA all right there we go look at some possible comedy Lucy one B2B freebie Maria one a two a three A, so all we have to do is look at those be prime or the a prime.

1182
01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:53.940
Susan Snay: To see what side of the family that came from okay.

1183
01:54:54.150 --> 01:54:55.950
Leandro Graterol: Wait I did train twins.

1184
01:54:56.790 --> 01:55:09.690
Susan Snay: They were born Maria and Lucy are twins they were born together on the same day, some people accuse them of not being twins but we've just proven with our rules that they that they are.

1185
01:55:10.050 --> 01:55:12.570
Jessica Zaleski: But let's go back, are they identical twins.

1186
01:55:12.630 --> 01:55:16.380
Jessica Zaleski: No, no, do they have the exact same DNA.

1187
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:18.270
Jessica Zaleski: No, no.

1188
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:20.340
Jessica Zaleski: So this is not an issue of.

1189
01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:29.100
Jessica Zaleski: Like the egg what Uli talked about where the egg and the sperm camborne combined for this I go and then the zygote splits.

1190
01:55:29.190 --> 01:55:31.740
Sarah Michaels: This is two different eggs and two different sperm.

1191
01:55:31.770 --> 01:55:49.680
Jessica Zaleski: Exactly, and that can happen in species, you know twins that are born at the same time, but they don't look like does anybody know twins that are brother and sister babies that were born on the same day that our brother they didn't come from the same as I go did they.

1192
01:55:51.930 --> 01:55:52.590
Sarah Michaels: couldn't.

1193
01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:57.990
Jessica Zaleski: Because they they can't have the exact same genetic information if there are a male and a female.

1194
01:55:58.290 --> 01:56:00.210
Sarah Michaels: Not on this, the 23rd chromosome.

1195
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:00.810
know.

1196
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:15.840
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so how much variation as possible, so we thought we had three pairs of chromosomes and we found out that there were eight possible common when we looked at lucien maria's the different possible combinations for gametes.

1197
01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:18.420
Susan Snay: We have way, more than three pairs.

1198
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:32.730
Jessica Zaleski: Alright, so we're going to kind of jump through this quickly if we want to do, using two and three to get eight, we could say to to the third power there were three okay three pairs of chromosomes.

1199
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:52.500
Jessica Zaleski: All right, you're doing sets of two so three sets of two would give us a possible combinations but humans don't have three sets of chromosomes how many do we have 2323 okay.

1200
01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.530
Jessica Zaleski: So two grandsons.

1201
01:56:55.830 --> 01:57:00.120
Jessica Zaleski: So how many possible combinations for humans that little.

1202
01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:04.440
Susan Snay: End that's above the two yeah and we would say.

1203
01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:09.360
Jessica Zaleski: To because it's pairs to the how many pairs to human tough.

1204
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:13.080
salam: When it 320 23rd.

1205
01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:24.360
Jessica Zaleski: Number somebody take a gas, what do you think to to the 23rd power is if to to the third power is eight, what do you think to to the 23rd power is.

1206
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.760
Sarah Michaels: Always that like two times two.

1207
01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:29.280
Sarah Michaels: times.

1208
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.960
Jessica Zaleski: Three times exactly.

1209
01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:35.130
Sarah Michaels: So you could actually multiply that out, but.

1210
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:38.100
Jessica Zaleski: i'm just take a guess what do you guys think.

1211
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:40.530
salam: it's.

1212
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:42.900
Jessica Zaleski: 16 okay.

1213
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.120
Susan Snay: Take a guess type it in the chat real quick.

1214
01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.650
Susan Snay: quickly fast.

1215
01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:52.050
Susan Snay: it's more than eight, you know that just take a guess all right so i'm says 46.

1216
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.710
Okay.

1217
01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:58.620
Jessica Zaleski: So we're talking about different combinations like if we if we had you know.

1218
01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:17.550
Jessica Zaleski: All those eggs aligned up and we were pulling chromosomes and randomly Now this is this is in a human gimme in a human sperm or in a human egg how many different chromosome combinations can a male make with his sperm or a female make with her eggs.

1219
01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:22.740
Susan Snay: So, all we have right now it's 4664 whoa.

1220
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:24.480
Jessica Zaleski: Looking at this number.

1221
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:27.030
Sarah Michaels: three.

1222
01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:28.680
Reggie: Is you know it's funny.

1223
01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.040
Reggie: I just I just did right now.

1224
01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:32.850
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, look at.

1225
01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.990
Jessica Zaleski: This calculator that's awesome.

1226
01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:38.910
Sarah Michaels: Oh, that up, I want to get a screenshot.

1227
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:41.670
Sarah Michaels: That is too cool.

1228
01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.530
Susan Snay: Thanks for checking their work.

1229
01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:45.990
Sarah Michaels: is beautiful reggie.

1230
01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:49.050
Susan Snay: That is a little different combinations.

1231
01:58:49.110 --> 01:58:55.650
Jessica Zaleski: And remember that's just the gametes okay that's not when.

1232
01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.850
Susan Snay: The sperm and.

1233
01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:58.800
Jessica Zaleski: Egg then combine.

1234
01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:01.500
Susan Snay: Well there's even not combinations.

1235
01:59:01.650 --> 01:59:14.250
Jessica Zaleski: Millions of possibilities that, like you, as a female could make of eggs and US male could make of sperm, and then the randomness of that combining.

1236
01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:18.600
Jessica Zaleski: So you can see why people look so different right.

1237
01:59:19.770 --> 01:59:21.060
Sarah Michaels: What we're all the same.

1238
01:59:21.150 --> 01:59:22.080
Exactly.

1239
01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:26.310
Jessica Zaleski: it's a lot of variation a lot of variation.

1240
01:59:27.630 --> 01:59:51.660
Jessica Zaleski: So when you think about you know, is it reasonable, given that you know, Maria and lucy's parents, they didn't just have eight possible gametes to give to combine to form those I goats that became Lucy and Maria they had over 8,000,002 gifts each each.

1241
01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.730
Susan Snay: And then those combined.

1242
01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.040
Susan Snay: into the zygote.

1243
01:59:56.790 --> 02:00:05.700
Jessica Zaleski: So do you think it's it's more amazing when brothers and sisters look a lot of like or when they look very different thinking about this.

1244
02:00:06.330 --> 02:00:07.560
Leandro Graterol: One to look different.

1245
02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:10.290
salam: I think, is using both ways.

1246
02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:11.040
yeah.

1247
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:13.740
Sarah Michaels: Did you say more.

1248
02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:18.000
Sarah Michaels: Or what somebody else think it's amazing both ways.

1249
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:24.150
Sarah Michaels: We look alike, look at the numbers just.

1250
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:29.460
Leandro Graterol: When I see the number, I was like oh my God.

1251
02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:33.570
Susan Snay: I never thought that right.

1252
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:36.120
Leandro Graterol: Oh, legalistic do fourier or.

1253
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:36.480
yeah.

1254
02:00:37.590 --> 02:00:40.110
salam: yeah I was thinking for for a second cousin.

1255
02:00:42.210 --> 02:00:42.360
Jessica Zaleski: yeah.

1256
02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:44.040
Susan Snay: passing over.

1257
02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:48.450
Jessica Zaleski: So, so what this means is, if you could have.

1258
02:00:49.560 --> 02:01:11.370
Jessica Zaleski: 8 million if you as a woman could produce 8,000,380 8608 eggs in your lifetime and have them result in children, even with one the same sperm, you would still have over 8 million children that had different chromosomes.

1259
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:14.490
Jessica Zaleski: Different variations.

1260
02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:17.250
Jessica Zaleski: I mean that is crazy.

1261
02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:21.660
Jessica Zaleski: All right.

1262
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:24.570
Jessica Zaleski: lot to think about it is so.

1263
02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.840
Susan Snay: you're going to think about that every time you look at your siblings now, and you will.

1264
02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:28.140
Be.

1265
02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:35.580
Jessica Zaleski: Alright So hopefully we've and maybe we might be able to loop back to this for a few minutes tomorrow, just to talk about.

1266
02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:50.550
Jessica Zaleski: Lucy and Maria and how they can look so different, but it is for 59 right now and misnamed can you just remind everyone what they will need for the DNA extraction lab tomorrow okay so remember, we talked about.

1267
02:01:52.260 --> 02:02:05.340
Jessica Zaleski: needing the ISO purple alcohol and I am going to go deliver that as soon as we get off the phone i'm gonna take a ride to Western to deliver that to Nikki Elio I still have his addressees season in Florida.

1268
02:02:05.370 --> 02:02:05.610

02:02:19.290 --> 02:02:22.710
Susan Snay: Oh no i'm going to be leaving soon as like within five minutes i'm leaving my house.

1273
02:02:23.190 --> 02:02:27.450
Jessica Zaleski: So we have to mistakes got to deliver this tonight because we're doing this lab tomorrow.

1274
02:02:28.830 --> 02:02:29.310
Leandro Graterol: Okay.

1275
02:02:30.330 --> 02:02:33.810
Jessica Zaleski: So remember everybody needs salt some dish soap.

1276
02:02:34.890 --> 02:02:36.180
Jessica Zaleski: Some alcohol.

1277
02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:47.700
Jessica Zaleski: A paper towel or coffee filter a baggie and a spoon and a piece of fruit and if you don't have a piece of fruit Okay, a cup yeah yeah.

Leandro Graterol: We can move on don't worry don't worry I have hope so.

1280
02:02:56.730 --> 02:02:57.870
Susan Snay: Oh, you do.

Right.

1296
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.960
Good now.

1297

Jessica Zaleski: I can put the picture up no problem.

1298
02:03:54.090 --> 02:04:00.420
Jessica Zaleski: That up again here, it is these and I look at don't don't let the salt confused you.

1299
02:04:00.810 --> 02:04:09.810
Jessica Zaleski: may not need it's either type of salt okay you don't need iodized and kosher it's just you need salt, one of the kinds.

1300
02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.490
Susan Snay: Any dish dish soap.

1301
02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:14.040
Jessica Zaleski: If you have a salt shaker like this in your.

1302
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:15.780
Jessica Zaleski: house with salt in it you're fine.

1303
