WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.759
Margaret Foster: Because if we record to the cloud, then

2
00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.620
Sarah Michaels: Record to your computer.

3
00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.630
Margaret Foster: No, because if we record to the cloud that there's a way to get it to automatically transcribed.

4
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.340
Sarah Michaels: Oh, well, we could try that I've just never done that night. It's a, it's a little bit more complicated. I just didn't want to

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.220
Sarah Michaels: Okay, let's try it.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.580
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I'm good. I quickly look up but or oh no he has to show us that out first. Yeah.

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.950
Cat Mai: Oh, sure. Okay, I'll share my screen.

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.090
Cat Mai: Oh, can you enable participants venture

9
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.090
Cat Mai: Run this

10
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.110
Cat Mai: Can you see something popped up.

11
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.800
Margaret Foster: Yes.

12
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:07.650
Cat Mai: Okay, so, so I'm open the CSV file first. So this is what our transcript looks like.

13
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.660
Cat Mai: Raw

14
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.740
Cat Mai: OK, so I'll browse click on it.

15
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.850
Margaret Foster: Oh, I think we only see the the code.

16
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.900
Oh,

17
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.160
Margaret Foster: You can click New share and then just click Share screen and then we'll see everything.

18
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.340
Cat Mai: Okay, new share

19
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.460
Cat Mai: Can you see my

20
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.260
Margaret Foster: Screen transcript. Yep. Yes.

21
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.250
Cat Mai: Alright, cool.

22
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.990
Cat Mai: So, um, can you see a window popped up.

23
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.920
Margaret Foster: Yes.

24
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.490
Cat Mai: OK, cool. So I just click the transcript.

25
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:06.000
Cat Mai: It's just like our transcript. I'm the function, it just rubbish just clean elsewhere bracket. So I click on it and now I say that, say like result.

26
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.820
Cat Mai: Okay, um,

27
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.600
Cat Mai: How it looks like because that was a little fast.

28
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.790
Cat Mai: Okay.

29
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.530
Cat Mai: Do you see the Excel.

30
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.040
Yep.

31
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.990
Cat Mai: So after after everyone around the pro file it cleans all the square brackets out of

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.080
Sarah Michaels: Brilliant. Well,

33
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:49.080
Cat Mai: If there's like later features that we want, I can just write it. That's like a demo function to clean our reach transferred out of the attacks.

34
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.360
Sarah Michaels: That is so cool.

35
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.120
Sarah Michaels: So that if we

36
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.400
Sarah Michaels: So that if we we could read. We could have the two columns.

37
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.170
Sarah Michaels: I guess you could work. Huh.

38
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.360
Sarah Michaels: Would you Word Wrap.

39
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:20.610
Sarah Michaels: That would be kind of hard. But anyway, you could you could read it in either column you could get the contextual stuff and then you could just get the words at the speaker spoke

40
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.250
Margaret Foster: And then like

41
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.010
Margaret Foster: For me I think the biggest thing is that this means that we don't have to be as careful about

42
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.830
Margaret Foster: Like not having spaces in between brackets and stuff anymore because for like the CDA account.

43
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.230
Margaret Foster: That was like the big thing that we talked so much about last year, like, make sure that you don't have too many spaces between your brackets and your parentheses and stuff.

44
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.620
Margaret Foster: Make sure that all your words run together. So it only counts as one word, but if we can just take out the brackets, then

45
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.470
Margaret Foster: It'll be much easier to just run

46
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.650
Margaret Foster: The clean transcript through CD to get an accurate word count. Right.

47
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:11.010
Sarah Michaels: So let me just with overlaps and stuff. What, what, and what happens there, because we, I think we put those in brackets as well. And that may be fine. Just get rid of them, but

48
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:22.890
Cat Mai: Usually, so I can customize it every way. So I can clean out only D op or I can clean up the spaces into practice so that the transcript looks the same, just without the space.

49
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:40.230
Cat Mai: Um, I think the norm now is to put the O v e and d overlapping more like just I'm saying, really simple. Like, that's great. Yeah. And then we do use that as far brackets, so that way we can just clean out the space for a CPA.

50
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.560
Sarah Michaels: Can, can you find an Ovi in this example transcript.

51
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.240
Cat Mai: This I think this was an old one. We didn't migrate to

52
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.900
Sarah Michaels: Be

53
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.390
Cat Mai: Yeah. So usually, it would just be like this. So,

54
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.350
I say

55
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.670
Margaret Foster: And Sarah. What we did later to is

56
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:13.320
Margaret Foster: So like how it was saying the back channel cues get embedded in brackets and then if somebody overlaps, but says something substantive then we put an Ovi

57
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:22.740
Margaret Foster: In the middle of the longer term, where they overlap and then again like had said put like you begin with OB. But the idea being that nobody like

58
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.510
Margaret Foster: The only thing that's embedded and then would be cleaned with cleaning brackets would be a back channel queue. Right.

59
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.090
Sarah Michaels: And so those would disappear.

60
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.750
Cat Mai: Are currently in this in this demo.

61
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.560
Cat Mai: I can do that.

62
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.340
Sarah Michaels: I think that, so we wouldn't give anybody credit for any of those back channel. I think that's totally fine.

63
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.820
Sarah Michaels: Okay, that's, that's cool.

64
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.050
Sarah Michaels: And then if we wanted to run the CDA we would just take column D.

65
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.250
Sarah Michaels: And you know, we would just create a new

66
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.610
Sarah Michaels: One, what would you, how would you then you've got your line number, your time code your speaker. Right.

67
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:20.670
Cat Mai: Um, so this is for either easier to compare. I can also make them just replace everything because you're saving in a different file. You're not replacing the original file. So you can do whatever with it.

68
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.430
Sarah Michaels: I say, yeah.

69
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.840
Sarah Michaels: So,

70
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.970
Sarah Michaels: What would be nice for me is to see this. So is this the full sound.

71
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.370
Sarah Michaels: Virtual study group.

72
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.000
Cat Mai: I think this what

73
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.570
Was

74
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.190
Cat Mai: It was yeah 2017

75
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.490
Cat Mai: Okay. SOUND virtual group. Yeah.

76
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.900
Sarah Michaels: So I'd like to, I'd like to run it in CDA and see what it looks like.

77
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.470
Sarah Michaels: So that we could actually examine you know where the, where the turn depth is and all that stuff.

78
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.570
Sarah Michaels: So,

79
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:20.010
Sarah Michaels: Could you could you set it up so that CDA can handle it and run it and get a visualization that and then we could talk about that at another time.

80
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.710
Cat Mai: What do you mean by running to see dear, this just the same transcription. So it doesn't change anything.

81
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.930
Sarah Michaels: No, I mean, put it through.

82
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.330
Sarah Michaels: So that we call visualizations.

83
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.210
Cat Mai: Oh, for, is there anything specific public transfer. This is an old one. I just pull it up for

84
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.400
Sarah Michaels: Yeah yeah i mean

85
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:53.670
Sarah Michaels: To some extent I I want us to think about what we can do is CDA in any of our transcripts, if you had one from our work with Sue and Jess, that would be even better.

86
00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:06.180
Sarah Michaels: If, if a transcript. A good transcript. A good significant transcript exists. So, not one of the virtual study groups, but a real Sue ingests transcript.

87
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.860
Sarah Michaels: Maggie, I don't know if you have a father. Do we have a good solid one

88
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.260
Cat Mai: Can you see my screen.

89
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.760
Sarah Michaels: Yeah yeah yeah

90
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.310
Cat Mai: I think this was that VA CDs.

91
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:29.460
Sarah Michaels: This is that CDA okay so you can see lots of greens and lots of in a few places, maybe that you want to look at. So the next step with and so

92
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:45.330
Sarah Michaels: So the next step with CDA is to actual actually think about codes coding and that's the next step that we have not investigated, so you can you can code up to nine codes. Yep.

93
00:08:48.090 --> 00:09:06.990
Sarah Michaels: And it's a question of which which codes we pick and that would be something we'd have to decide. But then, so I guess there's a part of me that wants to start with a transcript that we can appreciate, I'd love to do it with a su and just one where we know what we're interested in.

94
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:16.170
Sarah Michaels: And begin to explore the coding, not just the visualization with turn, you know, turn length and words per turn, and

95
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.540
Sarah Michaels: Turn depth.

96
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:31.980
Sarah Michaels: So could I cast. So this is, I didn't want to get into the specific things, but could I task you with for a next meeting, selecting one of the

97
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:43.380
Sarah Michaels: Longer transcripts from soon. Just this year cleaning it for CDA and then running some CDA visualization

98
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.390
Sarah Michaels: And then

99
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:56.280
Sarah Michaels: Spending time looking at it and thinking about coding the transcript. Now that that we haven't can can run it on CDA

100
00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.340
Cat Mai: Yeah.

101
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.590
Sarah Michaels: Maybe together, we should think about which one. And we've got a bunch of transcripts, Maggie. You've, you've seen

102
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:21.420
Margaret Foster: In terms of like a whole class transcript. I think we only have the scientist circles, and I would be concerned about using those because I'm not sure.

103
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:31.590
Margaret Foster: About the like cat. You just finished the second scientist circle, but nobody's looked at it to translate it yet, or to transcribe this finish so

104
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:40.200
Margaret Foster: That might be a limitation of using a longer transcript, but I know that there are a bunch of shorter ones that we could use for some of the different routines.

105
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.310
Sarah Michaels: So we want to pick a good

106
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:55.260
Sarah Michaels: You know MIDI transcript to to work with, just to explore the potential of CDA

107
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.570
Sarah Michaels: So,

108
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.910
Sarah Michaels: To Maggie. Do you have any recommendations.

109
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.420
Margaret Foster: An account. If you have any two

110
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.520
Sarah Michaels: Ways you can do you have a

111
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.460
Sarah Michaels: hunch about what would be a good one to start with.

112
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:23.520
Cat Mai: Um, I really don't know. I thought the science of circle will be pretty good. There's a lot of students. SPEAKING SPANISH as

113
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.660
Sarah Michaels: Well, so it's not translated. Is that what you're saying.

114
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.290
Cat Mai: Is like is messy. I guess because there's a lot of times worse even just chatting with each other.

115
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.920
Cat Mai: We don't know. It just, they're actually. Yeah, we don't know what's happening. But that might be

116
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:53.970
Sarah Michaels: So you did. You did the second scientist circle right well I remind me which which did you think was better which scientists circle was better.

117
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.040
Cat Mai: Um, I forgot was was the first one.

118
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.410
Sarah Michaels: I think the first one.

119
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.660
Margaret Foster: First one was about unity and diversity, like what was

120
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.380
Sarah Michaels: Very early and you an Oscar was there.

121
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.490
Margaret Foster: Your scar.

122
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.270
Scar

123
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.180
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I thought there was a different version of this one.

124
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.890
Margaret Foster: Maybe not.

125
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:28.170
Margaret Foster: But this one, I think, does have Spanish in it. This is the first scientists circle.

126
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.050
Margaret Foster: Yeah, and obvious especially beginning has been translated

127
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.570
Margaret Foster: Sorry, I'm struggling

128
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.650
Margaret Foster: Oh, it's the end. That's why. Okay. Yeah. So this one does have the Spanish in it. So, this one might be good.

129
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.620
Sarah Michaels: So,

130
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:55.500
Sarah Michaels: Show me a place where there's so is the Spanish translated in brackets or what

131
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.530
Sarah Michaels: Over there.

132
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.140
Sarah Michaels: Oh, interesting. Okay.

133
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.100
Margaret Foster: And then there's a it looks like there's a couple places where like

134
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:13.530
Margaret Foster: Like I haven't looked at this closely, personally, so it looks like. Here is a place where maybe Oscar should have a different turn

135
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.030
Margaret Foster: And like, yeah, some places embedded here too.

136
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.190
Sarah Michaels: Oh, in the second, the second scientist circle.

137
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.370
Sarah Michaels: I think it was during

138
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.780
Margaret Foster: Population dynamics, but we can't you just do. Yeah.

139
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.590
Cat Mai: It was it was felt numb selection natural selection.

140
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.090
Uh huh. Yeah.

141
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.950
Cat Mai: Yeah, young you talk us talk about the green, snake, snake and

142
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.010
Sarah Michaels: Okay, right, right, right, right.

143
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.720
Sarah Michaels: And the hairy people

144
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.500
There. Yeah.

145
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:05.100
Sarah Michaels: So yeah, that was a cool one. That was cool. So what would it take to work up both transcripts.

146
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:12.600
Sarah Michaels: That is clean them up a bit, so that they could be cleaned for CDA

147
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.030
Sarah Michaels: What, how much time would it takes so cat. If you were to

148
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:39.270
Sarah Michaels: Re listen to them. I'm not so concerned about this translation of the Spanish at this point, but we would have to do that, you know, we will have to get but I'm if we have basically the words that people spoke and maybe there'll be in parentheses, if we're not sure what they're saying.

149
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.020
Sarah Michaels: There will be brackets, which can be claimed.

150
00:14:46.140 --> 00:15:01.110
Sarah Michaels: What how long would it. So if you would go through the first transcript just listening to it and just checking and making sure and then put it in the right form for CDA. How long do you think that would take you

151
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:11.760
Cat Mai: And if it's just for cleaning first year that we pretty quick, but not sure about listening to it. What do you want me to look for when I'm listening to it.

152
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.810
Well,

153
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.610
Sarah Michaels: I don't know who transcribed. The first one

154
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.320
Sarah Michaels: But

155
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:33.660
Sarah Michaels: The Sunday. Okay, so it's it's probably good, it's probably good so clean it for CDA that won't take very long. And you just did the second one. So you said, the second one is rough. What do you mean by that.

156
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.400
Cat Mai: So out of Spanish

157
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:45.810
Sarah Michaels: And so when you came to Spanish. What did you do, you just sort of said dot dot dot and Eddie will fix this or something.

158
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.240
Cat Mai: I put us were practicing Spanish

159
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.230
Sarah Michaels: You put in square brackets in Spanish. So we don't know how many words or anything like that.

160
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.340
Sarah Michaels: I think that's

161
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.690
Sarah Michaels: I think that's okay. I mean, what would it take to get somebody

162
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:08.700
Sarah Michaels: To be able to translate the Spanish that's hard because that is just not he's not with us.

163
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.920
Margaret Foster: We can ask her. Oh, sorry to set

164
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.550
Cat Mai: A Maggie. Are you free enough to do it.

165
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.080
Sarah Michaels: I don't think you have the bandwidth

166
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:29.610
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I can I can I can try. I, my concern is more if I will understand them or not.

167
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:48.630
Sarah Michaels: And even if it was kind of adjust you did the very best. You couldn't you know in English. So, so what we could do in the translated version is to say, Spanish and then put a just in English as close as you could get

168
00:16:49.110 --> 00:17:04.500
Margaret Foster: And then mean I don't know. That would be saying like translates fine. I mean, I'm not sure I'd be able to understand what they're saying in Spanish, but I could go through and do my best. And then if it isn't like I'll spend a couple hours on it. And then if I can't. Yeah.

169
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.380
Sarah Michaels: Now the alternative would be for you to talk to the person who does speak Spanish, and who you might

170
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.430
Sarah Michaels: So to just really turn that

171
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:24.510
Sarah Michaels: That kind of work over to somebody else, which might take enough of your time anyway. It might. It might be worth it. But there is something about having a Spanish

172
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.490
Sarah Michaels: Speaker in the system that would be really great before you leave.

173
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.260
Margaret Foster: Yeah, and I also know more about

174
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:42.810
Margaret Foster: Like sorry quick sidebar will know more about like summer work stuff. There's a staff meeting on Thursday that

175
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.570
Margaret Foster: Where everybody will get more information about like

176
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:56.940
Margaret Foster: Summer work forums and what does Student Employment look like over the, over the summer and stuff. Because right now, the issue is that we can't hire anybody new like we got an exception for account because her stuff was already in

177
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:11.910
Margaret Foster: Like in progress. Before coming to you, but like the like we can't hire any more students right now. But when it turns over to summer it's possible that that will be lifted and we'll be able to do that again. But I'm not sure.

178
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.630
Sarah Michaels: So for a plan. So if if cat.

179
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:30.510
Sarah Michaels: cleans the first scientist circle for CDA and Maggie spends a couple of hours trying to get some just. It could be, in essence, it could be in Spanish or in English, it doesn't

180
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:43.230
Sarah Michaels: Eventually when we start to code for the content and stuff. But if you could spend a little bit of time on that. And then cat could put that into form.

181
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:54.330
Sarah Michaels: And we could run the two visualizations, I think, then we could start looking at them and thinking about what kinds of things we might want to code for

182
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:05.790
Sarah Michaels: And then once we can play around with that we could, I mean, again, it would be kind of cool to be able to code all of our transcript.

183
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.530
Sarah Michaels: Bits if we wanted to. I'm not sure.

184
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:23.700
Sarah Michaels: You know that we might really focus on teacher, teacher moves, just for now we could code for complexity, just very simple

185
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:38.760
Sarah Michaels: issues around complexity for student participants anyway. Not sure what we will end up with, but at least we could get started and we could have a CDA working series of meetings.

186
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.000
Sarah Michaels: Across the next month or so.

187
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:58.890
Sarah Michaels: So that's that's that's CDA and that's really great. And I'll also talk with Cathy to think a little bit about how to investigate what we can do a CDA and she might want to join some of these conversations, that would be great.

188
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:14.130
Sarah Michaels: So now let's shift away from CDA and think about other things that oh, the other thing I was thinking, Maggie is

189
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:36.120
Sarah Michaels: One thing we can do with transcripts and this can be interview transcripts as well is grab grab a segment of a transcript that seems to relate to a theme so anytime there's anything relating division or something like that. We can code it.

190
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:52.230
Sarah Michaels: For for vision and you can grab this stuff around it and in vivo can handle that. So you're grabbing discourse data around some themes

191
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.130
Sarah Michaels: And then you can look at what's actually being said

192
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:06.000
Sarah Michaels: And so that's a different mean what Gina unfortunately is doing is just looking for words, at this point, which is not going to get us very far.

193
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:17.430
Sarah Michaels: But what you can do is use your intuitive notion about a word like vision and read through the transcript for anything that seems related to vision.

194
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:29.280
Sarah Michaels: And grab the talk around it. It could be the prompt that comes first and then the. It could be a paragraph or two. It could be a sentence or two. I mean,

195
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:44.880
Sarah Michaels: But then we would have discourse data about something. And now we could think about what kind of what kind of what's interesting about it and how it what's going on. We could look at sort of related

196
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.990
Sarah Michaels: Chunks of discourse.

197
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.680
Margaret Foster: Are you talking about the Connecticut case study.

198
00:21:52.920 --> 00:22:05.910
Sarah Michaels: I'm thinking about interviewing Sue and Jess, I'm thinking about interviewing Liz Butner that what we may want to do interviewing the kids what we may want is some topical.

199
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:19.710
Sarah Michaels: Chunks and look closely at how kids talk about x. And that's another. That's another use of CDA you just say vision.

200
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:31.320
Sarah Michaels: And you can see in the transcript. Where is that happening. And then we could go and look there and try to see what what we see in other words we could use some

201
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:49.140
Sarah Michaels: Basic CDA stuff for telling us as humans, what might be worth looking at as a chunk. Another thing. So the but in vivo. Does that also in vivo allows you to go through a transcript.

202
00:22:50.040 --> 00:23:14.070
Sarah Michaels: Copy you chunk it part and then organize all those chunks and start reading through them. So we may not need CDA but then the question is cat. Do you know how to do that in in vivo. So another question of a topic would be, should we get cat to be an more expert at using

203
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.790
Sarah Michaels: Qualitative software that we might find useful in the project.

204
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.170
Sarah Michaels: And I don't know. So can you probably if you ever heard of in vivo.

205
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:27.750
Cat Mai: I don't think so.

206
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:44.100
Sarah Michaels: It's, it's just one among many qualitative software packages that allows you to do some coding and looking at the the chunks that you've coded

207
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:58.200
Sarah Michaels: And developing higher and higher codes or whatever. But you can work with discourse data with in vivo, because you can take a whole big part and give it a code.

208
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:08.580
Sarah Michaels: And then you can ask for all the instances of that code and it will just put it into a an organized so we could look at all the

209
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.500
Sarah Michaels: Maggie's

210
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.610
Sarah Michaels: You want to share

211
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.610
Sarah Michaels: I can't hear you.

212
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:34.560
Margaret Foster: Sorry. Um, I've been told that recently my audio has been really bad or gotten really like for. So I've been trying to get myself muted there was

213
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:44.910
Margaret Foster: It's been a very long time since I've used this. Oh my gosh, I'm so basically the idea. This is not a good example. This is empty.

214
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.460
Margaret Foster: The

215
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.380
Margaret Foster: Man.

216
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.250
Sarah Michaels: We could look at what's his faces.

217
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.220
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I'm

218
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.020
Margaret Foster: Saying

219
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.770
Margaret Foster: This is interesting.

220
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:09.930
Margaret Foster: Yeah, so

221
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:32.100
Margaret Foster: Yeah, actually, the sun, basically, that you can like put transcripts into here and then you are like put text into here and then you highlight it and you can do different stuff with like they call them nodes, instead of codes and you can do a whole lot of different stuff like visualizing

222
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.770
Margaret Foster: The coding stripes.

223
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:44.910
Margaret Foster: You can like link different memos zoom in and out do different at yeah word cloud just all the stuff that I have never had time

224
00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:49.140
Sarah Michaels: That a word cloud. Oh my god. People big cities you

225
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.910
Sarah Michaels: Funny.

226
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.260
Margaret Foster: Oh my gosh.

227
00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:02.970
Sarah Michaels: So, so that's another. That's another question in vivo is, you know, there's a learning curve and

228
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:20.430
Sarah Michaels: It's only as good as your ideas about what's to be coded and all that stuff. But it is a, it's a, it's a, you know, it's a tool that makes certain things easier to notice and see with visualizations.

229
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:39.930
Sarah Michaels: I've never used it. I'm not, therefore, it would it would be not something I'm able to guide us on exactly because I'd have to also learn you know what its capabilities are. We'd have to play around with stuff but So Maggie, you were, you were trying to

230
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:50.670
Sarah Michaels: Play around with it and focus on some of the things we were interested in orienteering and, you know, again, if we go back to thinking about to and Jess.

231
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.970
Sarah Michaels: We might

232
00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:04.140
Margaret Foster: Sorry, this is like you can have codes that you like click on along the side they do these coding stripe things. So you can look

233
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:21.900
Margaret Foster: And you click on the stripe and then it shows you all the different places where this code is so like less than timing, whatever that means. It's not my code and then when I click on it, I get to see all the different places that it's highlighted, both in the text and also over here.

234
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.030
Margaret Foster: Yeah, anyway, so there's there's a whole lot of different stuff that I'm not

235
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.950
Margaret Foster: Good at but that might be cool.

236
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.810
Sarah Michaels: So I'm going to suggest that we stop recording

237
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:43.770
Sarah Michaels: Because I don't think there's anything. What's just gone on that would be helpful for other people. And I might have said something not so nice.
