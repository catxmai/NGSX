[00:00:35.97];Margaret Foster; Hello, how are you
[00:00:38.01];Tina Chiem; I'm good, how are you
[00:00:40.35];Margaret Foster; I'm good. I think the recording is working and meeting waiting room so
[00:00:47.01];Tina Chiem; Oh sure, yeah.
[00:00:50.04];Margaret Foster; How are you doing lots of finals and stuff.
[00:00:54.03];Tina Chiem; Um, it's
[00:00:56.79];Tina Chiem; Not a lot, but I am not working on them as diligently as I should be
[00:01:08.61];Margaret Foster; Sarah and I found out earlier this week that the class that I'm teaching for her is pass fail and like had been before, which we didn't realize until recently. And so I kind of told them all on Tuesday. You know, I like I do understand if this changes how much
[00:01:28.26];Margaret Foster; Like energy you put into the final but please like tell me if you are planning on on you know either.
[00:01:36.90];Margaret Foster; Not head to get in or like having specifically
[00:01:42.12];Margaret Foster; Oh my gosh, Ashley, I found it actually
[00:01:45.66];Tina Chiem; Oh, yeah.
[00:01:47.52];Margaret Foster; No, there's someone in the waiting room and I don't know.
[00:01:56.28];Margaret Foster; Here, Sarah.
[00:02:01.50];smichaels; Hi there.
[00:02:02.94];Margaret Foster; Hi Sarah.
[00:02:03.69];Margaret Foster; We have one
[00:02:05.49];Margaret Foster; And potentially Sherman, but I'm not sure in the waiting room. Should I wait until Sue and Jessica here. Just let them in.
[00:02:18.66];smichaels; Wow, it's nine minutes early.
[00:02:21.84];smichaels; I'm trying to print off the questions and my printer just
[00:02:29.64];smichaels; Let's keep let's wait a little bit
[00:02:42.81];Margaret Foster; Yesterday, saying that Sherman este
[00:02:45.99];Margaret Foster; Or said that he can download the app. So asked for.
[00:02:49.98];Margaret Foster; The call it information, which is why I'm wondering if this is him. It just says iPhone. They actually but there's no Ashley in our class.
[00:02:58.86];Margaret Foster; But I wrote back with the instructions of, like, I tried it out myself. And so he should just be hearing like a waiting room type thing like he's on hold, is what the recording will say so. Yeah.
[00:03:12.42];unclear;Okay.
[00:03:14.76];smichaels; All right, let me think about how to practice.
[00:03:19.41];smichaels; I don't know how do you get the blue color on the Google Doc just
[00:03:22.86];Margaret Foster; I just sent it to you, Sarah as a boy.
[00:03:24.66];smichaels; I got I got I
[00:03:25.89];smichaels; Got it. But I'm wondering how you if I would have done it myself.
[00:03:31.65];Margaret Foster; So the way that you do it is you go to File Page Setup and page color.
[00:03:40.80];Margaret Foster; The iPhone left. So hopefully they'll call back in like five minutes.
[00:03:45.21];Margaret Foster; And the. Yeah. So I've been trying to look at my documents as some version of not white because it
[00:03:56.22];Margaret Foster; For me it's a similar function to like dimming a screen, it makes it easier on your eyes.
[00:04:02.40];Margaret Foster; printed document. It makes more sense to have a view black and white.
[00:04:06.27];smichaels; Yeah, I didn't want to use all that blue ink just for printing
[00:04:10.05];unclear;Huh.
[00:04:11.79];smichaels; Yep.
[00:04:14.97];smichaels; Yeah. All right.
[00:04:29.64];Margaret Foster; Tina. What's that photo from
[00:04:34.29];Tina Chiem; It's from ACS is the Lunar New Year. Back in January.
[00:04:39.93];Tina Chiem; Was it's actually a group photo but I cropped it out because
[00:04:42.90];Tina Chiem; Like
[00:04:43.53];Tina Chiem; I was like, it's fine, because the quality is good enough that I can prop it and then it'll still like not be pixel
[00:04:49.74];Margaret Foster; Looks good.
[00:04:51.12];unclear;Yeah.
[00:04:52.89];Margaret Foster; I feel it's very interesting. I feel like there's very different norms around like
[00:04:57.75];Margaret Foster; When to have your video up based on like
[00:05:02.22];Margaret Foster; Generation, but also like everybody. I feel like
[00:05:08.37];Margaret Foster; At least I've seen a lot of people whose video is off, just because
[00:05:13.56];Margaret Foster; The like the the bandwidth isn't enough to support both video and audio so like
[00:05:18.60];unclear;Yeah.
[00:05:21.81];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:05:22.71];Tina Chiem; Yeah, my video is currently off because I'm on my computer on zoom and my camera on my computer does not work.
[00:05:31.77];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:05:35.22];Margaret Foster; Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting I in the class I was taking it be you all of the students like and they're all graduate students that might be different, like whenever we would take a break or like whenever anybody would walk away from the camera, they would turn off their, their video
[00:05:52.35];Margaret Foster; Oh, yeah.
[00:05:54.51];Margaret Foster; Which is interesting.
[00:05:56.82];Margaret Foster; And there's
[00:05:58.32];smichaels; All right.
[00:06:00.99];Margaret Foster; Hello. So we had a
[00:06:04.47];Margaret Foster; An iPhone from Ashley in the waiting room about five minutes ago, but they left. So I'm assuming, they'll come back.
[00:06:17.13];unclear;Yeah.
[00:06:21.30];Margaret Foster; Oh, so you're muted. I'm sorry.
[00:06:27.24];sue snay; How do the people in the waiting room know that there's a meeting going on. Does it actually say on their end
[00:06:33.42];Margaret Foster; Yeah, so I, um, it's different if it's a phone call versus a like if you're using a phone or computer for the phone at Pace, it basically just puts you on hold and are like, Oh, like you're in the waiting room you're on hold the host will let you in soon.
[00:06:51.63];Margaret Foster; And then the boat for for a video call meeting it like there's a message that just says, like you're in the waiting room host will let you in. Soon, basically.
[00:07:02.10];Margaret Foster; Just fear, just say there was an iPhone in the waiting room.
[00:07:05.31];Margaret Foster; About six minutes ago so very early.
[00:07:09.63];Margaret Foster; So I decided to wait for more of us to comfort.
[00:07:13.89];Margaret Foster; The iPhone went away, but I'm assuming so
[00:07:17.70];smichaels; Um, so I just. Is there, is there anyone. Um, is there, it can we invite people in from the waiting you
[00:07:26.79];Margaret Foster; Know there's nobody in it now. So
[00:07:32.49];smichaels; You just, you can't
[00:07:33.99];Jessica Zaleski; Here's Pamela. Yes, I was gonna say
[00:07:36.54];Jessica Zaleski; She was just in a meeting with me for an hour for ESL
[00:07:39.72];sue snay; And she said she was
[00:07:40.92];Margaret Foster; Oh, oh my gosh, what
[00:07:44.82];Jessica Zaleski; She told me five times that she was coming to this, I had, I just had a Google meet with five of my students came. I was so thrilled. It was amazing, like
[00:07:56.07];Jessica Zaleski; For I haven't seen since we got out of school. So it was off and they're going to start texting their friends. So I think this might pick up some momentum here, you know,
[00:08:06.51];Margaret Foster; Very coming
[00:08:07.62];Margaret Foster; I did get a message from a Nisha and also have cow that they can't come because they have exams this afternoon so unfortunate for Portuguese, but we will do our best and it'll be fun.
[00:08:21.81];smichaels; Yeah.
[00:08:24.12];sue snay; Wow, you guys have much better lighting. I look like I'm on my deathbed.
[00:08:32.76];Margaret Foster; You
[00:08:35.34];sue snay; Very
[00:08:36.87];sue snay; much taller than I do.
[00:08:43.98];sue snay; Can turn the spotlight on hmm
[00:08:52.68];unclear;We know what
[00:08:54.78];sue snay; We ended up like everybody
[00:08:58.80];smichaels; Say that again. What
[00:09:00.66];sue snay; I did before we get to the end and I will be the last day. Oh.
[00:09:07.95];smichaels; Yeah.
[00:09:11.67];Margaret Foster; I'm suing Jess, I forgot to ask at the end of our meeting yesterday, if, if I should go ahead and schedule for 930 to 11 on Wednesday.
[00:09:20.52];Margaret Foster; Or if you want to wait until you know more about your schedule for next week before scheduling a meeting.
[00:09:27.39];sue snay; Apparently, we have to schedule a lot more meetings. We just had our faculty and and now they're suggesting that we work together as an entire team of biology teachers to do the same.
[00:09:43.41];sue snay; Lesson template according to what death. He has sent down to us.
[00:09:48.39];sue snay; So we're gonna have to try to schedule a South biology team, which I don't even know how that's going to leave amber because their suggestion was to make sure that everybody was following the same basic topics that death. He has set forth
[00:10:03.27];smichaels; That's fine.
[00:10:04.44];unclear;Whatever.
[00:10:07.23];sue snay; I'm not really even sure how it's going to go. I did invite say our my student teacher who's been doing 910 910 and 11 to talk with Jeff and I after this meeting to see if we leave it.
[00:10:22.32];smichaels; To be a missing.
[00:10:23.58];sue snay; And then we have to figure out how to get on the same page with the other three to five biology teachers as three regular bio teachers and two that are in the STEP program. So I'm sure they're gonna have to be part of it too. So there's going to be
[00:10:38.52];Jessica Zaleski; Well, I sent. Um, I had to stay on that meeting as one of the Google traffic meeting after and I said to Jeff, I don't see how scheduling it by department is going to work because
[00:10:53.07];Jessica Zaleski; Kids have to science classes or two math classes or two ESL classes. So how is that going to work and I sent him the template for what Grafton is doing with
[00:11:03.96];Jessica Zaleski; You know, they basically have like a period one period to period three for just 25 minutes
[00:11:10.53];Jessica Zaleski; And they rotate through their seven periods schedule twice in a week. And even if we did it once in a week. You know what I mean. For 20 minutes of some type of live interaction.
[00:11:22.26];Jessica Zaleski; It. We have to have a schedule this idea that they're saying of just teachers figure it out and
[00:11:28.35];Jessica Zaleski; Hopefully you don't overlap. I mean, and I understand where Jeff is coming from because we know that the Union will push back on this and he just doesn't want to waste a lot of time coming up with something that's not going to
[00:11:38.97];Jessica Zaleski; Ultimately be feasible, but to me as a teacher, it's way more frustrating to just try to schedule these things when I'm
[00:11:48.00];Margaret Foster; Here's time
[00:11:48.99];Jessica Zaleski; Oh, good, good.
[00:11:50.70];sue snay; Hey, Pamela Hi Pamela
[00:11:54.57];sue snay; Nice to see you.
[00:11:58.92];unclear;You hear us.

[00:13:04.65];sue snay; Yeah, that's a big deal.
[00:13:06.96];Jessica Zaleski; Worry about English
[00:13:08.31];Jessica Zaleski; You will pass the English. Don't worry about it.
[00:13:11.58];Pamela; You know,

[00:14:32.70];Pamela; But
[00:14:33.78];smichaels; Anyway, so do you guys think we should get started, just with Pamela, or should we wait another couple of minutes. What do you think
[00:14:45.03];Pamela; And then, sorry.
[00:14:49.05];smichaels; We, we wanted to talk with you, but with other with other students also. So should we wait a few minutes, or should we start

[00:20:59.73];Jessica Zaleski; So that's been a good night, man.
[00:21:01.98];Jessica Zaleski; I woke up this morning and they're all
[00:21:05.91];Jessica Zaleski; Talking to each other. And it was like they just discovered this
[00:21:09.21];Jessica Zaleski; This morning that they
[00:21:10.47];Jessica Zaleski; And now they're trying to get up on top of the router because they realized they can levitate, to some extent.
[00:21:15.57];Jessica Zaleski; So it is to start all
[00:21:19.68];Jessica Zaleski; Over
[00:21:19.98];sue snay; Wait till they get outside and they can figure out what they can actually fly a little bit much figured out, they can fly over the fat into the neighbor's yard.
[00:21:30.90];Jessica Zaleski; Oh, here's our ah
[00:21:42.54];Jessica Zaleski; just waking up.
[00:21:57.63];sue snay; Enough.

[00:24:20.85];smichaels; We wanted to ask you, and and everyone in your class.
[00:24:28.05];smichaels; Because you guys did so well on the m casts. We wanted to in biology also math, they are, but in biology, your class did really, really well.
[00:24:42.48];smichaels; On the M casts. And we wanted to ask you why you thought that happened. So do you have any thoughts about why you did so well on the m casts, was there anything about the class that you think helped you do well on the m casts
[00:25:10.41];Naiara Da Silva (Student); All because I think I

[00:28:10.62];smichaels; I'm
[00:28:12.39];smichaels; Sewer Jess, the snare missy. Can you think of any activities that come to mind from what you did that, that they might remember that Pamela, and I are might react. Right. Remember
[00:28:29.76];Jessica Zaleski; Let's see. Pamela, and I are. Do you remember when we played the game.
[00:28:35.28];Jessica Zaleski; When the moose on the board and the moose had babies and
[00:28:41.28];Jessica Zaleski; We had to say.
[00:28:42.51];Jessica Zaleski; They lived or they died.
[00:28:44.91];Jessica Zaleski; And if they had babies or offspring and we did it on the tables with the little cards. Do you remember that game.
[00:28:51.69];Pamela; Yes, yeah.

[00:29:01.59];Jessica Zaleski; It was very fun. Okay. Do you think it helped you to understand what we were talking about what in learning about in class.
[00:29:11.16];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Yes.
[00:29:12.81];smichaels; Okay, was there anything on the m casts that had to do with population dynamics or
[00:29:21.66];smichaels; A population growing or
[00:29:25.50];smichaels; getting smaller.
[00:29:29.67];smichaels; Did they test you about any of that on the zoom cast
[00:29:35.79];Naiara Da Silva (Student); As I said, it was a bunch of things, you know,
[00:29:42.93];sue snay; What questions that might have asked
[00:29:46.65];sue snay; Why or how populations.
[00:29:49.77];sue snay; Grow or decline.
[00:29:55.02];sue snay; Get bigger or smaller.
[00:29:59.58];Pamela; You know,
[00:30:03.33];Jessica Zaleski; No, it's hard to remember
[00:30:05.19];Jessica Zaleski; It is, I mean, you took that test. She almost. I mean, three months ago now and
[00:30:11.40];Jessica Zaleski; You know, even, even then we know that the language on the test was challenging and difficult for you, so I'm probably if we asked you these questions closer to the task you, you remember, but it's hard to remember. You know, it's hard to remember that far back.
[00:30:30.30];Jessica Zaleski; I'm trying to think of some other
[00:30:33.69];smichaels; Pipe Cleaners with the, the twins and making a baby a boy or girl.

[00:31:00.54];Jessica Zaleski; I don't know if an IRR was here at the beginning of the year. Do you remember when we had the cylinders. The big white cylinders with the ropes, we call them the magic cylinders.
[00:31:14.70];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Oh, hi. Yes, yes.
[00:31:16.11];Jessica Zaleski; You remember that.
[00:31:18.81];Jessica Zaleski; Joy that

[00:31:45.03];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Yes.
[00:31:47.22];smichaels; Which one in Brazil. Mm hmm.
[00:31:51.09];smichaels; Um, how was it different, or how is it the same how, how did this biology class.
[00:32:02.49];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Is this thing, because we will learn this before.
[00:32:09.96];sue snay; Do you think
[00:32:12.39];sue snay; Is it the same as in the same material, the same topics.
[00:32:17.64];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Um, no, we miss. Cool. We really don't use materials or
[00:32:25.11];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Any
[00:32:29.88];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Materials is
[00:32:31.53];Pamela; Nice. Cool.
[00:32:35.01];Jessica Zaleski; So, so the way that you learned it in Brazil was different, but was it the same information like did you learn about the day in Brazil in your biology. Okay, learn about um cells and
[00:32:50.79];Jessica Zaleski; Meiosis mitosis in Brazil.
[00:32:54.00];Pamela; Okay. Hey, nice, cool. Um,
[00:32:58.11];Pamela; Have one room.
[00:33:00.66];unclear;Okay.
[00:33:04.86];Jessica Zaleski; How many students were in your class in Brazil in your science class.
[00:33:09.69];Naiara Da Silva (Student); But then she was quite a
[00:33:15.81];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Chemist thing she
[00:33:18.00];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Is 40
[00:33:20.64];Jessica Zaleski; Yeah 40. Wow.
[00:33:22.68];sue snay; Wow zero
[00:33:39.36];Pamela; Yeah.
[00:33:42.12];smichaels; If
[00:33:43.65];smichaels; You can speak in Portuguese and we can
[00:33:46.23];unclear;Get
[00:33:50.22];smichaels; You can talk in Portuguese if you want
[00:33:52.65];smichaels; And the to occur locker stand
[00:33:56.04];Pamela; Up.
[00:33:57.18];Pamela; To him, was he
[00:34:03.69];sue snay; Did in in Brazil. Did you have a lot of discussions talks in class with, you know, with each other.
[00:34:14.46];unclear;Your student on class.
[00:34:17.16];Pamela; We did.
[00:34:17.91];sue snay; Here. So you do
[00:34:20.73];smichaels; Yeah, Emily.
[00:34:22.11];unclear;Hi.
[00:34:25.26];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Sorry, I was a little late.
[00:34:27.00];unclear;So,
[00:34:28.47];smichaels; That's great.
[00:34:29.31];smichaels; It's great to have you.
[00:34:31.41];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); lost track time
[00:34:34.53];smichaels; So definitely, um, we're talking about the fact that all of you pass the M casts
[00:34:41.40];sue snay; And
[00:34:41.67];smichaels; General, the class this class did really well on the m casts, and we're trying to understand what kinds of things helped and what you liked about the way
[00:34:55.29];smichaels; Missy and misnamed taught and also. So we're just asking you questions about what what was helpful. What wasn't helpful and and you can talk, you guys can talk in Portuguese we'll, we'll do the best we can to understand you.
[00:35:14.67];smichaels; And leave
[00:35:16.05];Margaret Foster; Them right now hack Elsa, the exam. She couldn't be here, but she says hi and she's really sad.
[00:35:23.04];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:35:26.19];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Um,
[00:35:27.36];smichaels; So one last question that misnamed ask is, is. Did you guys have as much discussion and talking in small groups and whole class discussions or did the teacher tell you more talk more
[00:35:44.82];smichaels; In Brazil.
[00:35:46.77];unclear;And Brazil.
[00:35:49.23];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So it was usually like let's get your explains, and it's a whole conversation with the whole class, including the teacher. So it's kind of both. So the teacher explains and and we talk like us.
[00:36:04.32];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So yeah, it's kind of like
[00:36:07.59];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); half half
[00:36:10.26];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I think is more the teacher explain because sometimes we get lost in the conversation.
[00:36:15.33];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And start talking about it and then things
[00:36:18.03];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So has to enter the thing in
[00:36:21.81];smichaels; Can you say that in Portuguese just to make sure everybody understood
[00:36:26.76];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Um,
[00:36:28.35];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); No, but I was you know me talking wrestling professor
[00:36:33.39];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); When I click was a supporter that she
[00:36:37.08];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Was always come back converse I society for the converse so interesting open up a very simple song work with those
[00:36:45.60];Pamela; Key
[00:36:55.32];Pamela; Things that I learned from the capital for number two.
[00:37:02.10];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); But
[00:37:04.38];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); She's saying that like the students talk a lot about what the teacher is explaining I we go really into the conversation about the topic in class.
[00:37:16.98];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So when we get out of topic. I'm sorry. Talk about random things is I
[00:37:24.39];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); For a little moment and then we come back.
[00:37:29.25];Pamela; Up to the top.
[00:37:31.47];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And there's a lot of topics and say, oh, one which here, it's easier to understand, because like you guys did you explain one topic for time rosary you to have
[00:37:44.70];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Two or more topics at once it's assigned to get a little confusing, but we talked a lot about
[00:37:54.54];smichaels; My era.
[00:37:55.32];smichaels; You agree with all that
[00:37:57.90];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Okay.
[00:37:59.82];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Thank
[00:38:01.98];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); You for Your phone
[00:38:09.78];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Oh, yes.
[00:38:21.75];sue snay; We are taken out stock.
[00:38:24.48];sue snay; In zoom Google me and headphones all people like me, but never use these had
[00:38:33.48];sue snay; To use them every day.
[00:38:44.13];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Around the house. So there's one in the key chain does. There's one in my room. This one is
[00:38:49.47];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Always have
[00:38:50.70];unclear;One.
[00:38:54.21];Pamela; For
[00:39:00.96];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); My parents have lied to us.
[00:39:02.73];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So biggies. There's to me.
[00:39:08.73];smichaels; Um,
[00:39:10.59];smichaels; What what you said was interesting about
[00:39:15.42];smichaels; Talking in Brazil, and I'm curious if it was
[00:39:21.87];smichaels; If you liked participating in class here or if it was hard to participate. How do you feel about having first of all do you feel like you were expected to talk in
[00:39:36.18];smichaels; Missy and necessity class. Did you feel like you were supposed to be talking and talking with you know talking out loud to others in the class.
[00:39:48.57];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I'm kind of I felt like it was something I should do with something I could do to help me understand to and help others in case I have something I'd have to sit in a given
[00:40:00.12];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); But I never feel like I was obligated to do you know I was like that, that the option to give us because sometimes like sometimes you have to talk in other classes like oh you have soccer. You won't get points.
[00:40:15.03];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Or they'll take point from you.
[00:40:18.78];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Or sometimes we talking to her life is talking so
[00:40:22.56];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I like that auction things
[00:40:26.52];smichaels; Pamela. What do you think
[00:40:29.91];Pamela; For me it's hard because I understand English
[00:40:37.77];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); As a foreign for the
[00:40:41.31];Pamela; Things. He could barely
[00:40:43.20];unclear;Get by tomorrow.
[00:40:45.45];Naiara Da Silva (Student); I will say, also this negotiation dope. So
[00:40:49.32];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Do you follow our own or service. It also Jesus, it was, it was essentially gather fella. Let's do a circle, instead of my scope so Cisco switches
[00:40:59.73];Pamela; Principles, like a bicycle link redundancy and
[00:41:03.42];Pamela; Then
[00:41:04.59];Pamela; We should ever
[00:41:07.74];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Be
[00:41:08.22];unclear;Very
[00:41:10.68];Pamela; Good.
[00:41:12.57];Pamela; Year for me to school.
[00:41:14.01];Pamela; To graduate school was
[00:41:18.87];Pamela; Super Bass
[00:41:21.24];Pamela; And back to planning.
[00:41:22.89];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So she said she likes to get into conversations, which it doesn't do it a lot. He doesn't talk English very well still learning and to get nervous when she has to say something.
[00:41:37.14];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So she doesn't say too much for us to say to loves to participate in things and to have a conversation, but she doesn't really know how to
[00:41:52.23];sue snay; Remember that even people that only speak English get nervous when they talk
[00:41:59.22];sue snay; To
[00:42:05.91];sue snay; I really love that. But
[00:42:10.26];smichaels; How about you, in terms of this class. Did you feel like you had to participate or talk. Did you feel like you could speak up when you understand something, and wanted to share your idea or when you didn't understand something, and wanted to hear more.
[00:42:34.11];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Or less even I LUCKY YOU. I SHOULD WE COME HOME TO PULL as each grade supply converse.
[00:42:40.56];Naiara Da Silva (Student); airbrush for Michelle principal Moya, to be gotta we're going for my simply going to thing is a pair add to the conversation will continue to invest in San Mateo. He was, he put us bouquets much as you participate my
[00:42:58.77];Pamela; Thing thing.
[00:43:01.53];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Thing.
[00:43:03.87];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So now say that she loves to participate and have those conversations like student conversation, but she doesn't talk too much because she's shy to get Ty, like a little nervous too. So, but
[00:43:21.00];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); The little time we did for dissipate and did have
[00:43:23.73];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); A relationship loved it.
[00:43:26.01];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And she understands English, but she gets nervous.
[00:43:29.19];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); To talk like a little shy.
[00:43:33.00];smichaels; Interesting.
[00:43:36.45];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like me in the beginning.
[00:43:38.25];smichaels; Yeah.
[00:43:39.18];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I still am a little bit, but I'm trying to
[00:43:48.45];smichaels; Guess it's. I have a question for all three of you. Do you think that talking about these ideas in class helps you learn or do you learn just as much, if you're listening. If you're listening and hearing what others say do you think talking actually helps you
[00:44:07.83];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); To approved and C as in Charlie to converse as you listen. She can do materialize. Oh, size could die reversal JavaScript in the
[00:44:19.98];Pamela; Settings party position. So do with it.
[00:44:31.08];Pamela; Sorry, guys. I was speaking to
[00:44:38.94];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Say have conversations helps to understand more especially like when we say things and expressions that we understand like between us, so it's easier to understand, saw that
[00:44:55.35];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); That exponential like something you read a book, those difficult words, it's easier to understand. Yeah, we'll see here
[00:45:09.63];smichaels; What do you think
[00:45:12.78];Naiara Da Silva (Student); I think the same thing.
[00:45:20.43];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Days. Amazing Race, color.
[00:45:25.08];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Oh yeah, those you say like to say that when you talk in English. Here are now.
[00:45:34.53];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There's everything wrong because like was playing to for bullets as far away from school and this is the same thing. Like I was speaking everything roles that
[00:45:47.55];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I just get Portuguese so
[00:45:49.83];Margaret Foster; I was gonna say I do the same thing with like if anybody who spoke Spanish was going to come to dance could be like, oh, I really sorry I haven't practiced and like many weeks.
[00:46:00.27];Margaret Foster; Of please forgive me so totally get it. Yeah.
[00:46:04.92];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yeah.
[00:46:08.10];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like just 24 seven. SPEAKING PORTUGUESE
[00:46:11.04];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); No English
[00:46:12.33];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yeah, like I read in English, like my book or some things on my phone, but most of the things are being Portuguese yes I'm watching a lot of moves in Portuguese. Yeah.
[00:46:25.77];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); My English
[00:46:29.10];Pamela; My family talking Portuguese
[00:46:31.44];smichaels; Right, it might
[00:46:34.26];smichaels; Actually, one of the reasons it would be good. We're doing this in part is just to keep everybody. Yeah, keep everybody talking together talking English thinking about biology, that kind of thing. So yeah, that's good. I can understand. So I have another question.
[00:46:54.60];smichaels; About
[00:46:56.19];smichaels; The fact that Missy, and Miss s were co teaching
[00:47:02.37];smichaels; That's not typical but it's it's
[00:47:05.37];smichaels; Something that they are doing to see if it's helpful to have an ESL teacher, the sea and a biology teacher Miss ne working together. So I'm curious for you. What was it like to have both of the teachers, an ESL teacher and a biology teacher working together.
[00:47:30.54];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So let's go to battle because I don't have
[00:47:33.75];unclear;With
[00:47:39.18];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Big says the boys from facilities to paint. Would you be able to go to the analogy so well so so awesome. So
[00:47:47.28];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Airborne pretty
[00:47:49.89];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Cool.
[00:47:51.00];Naiara Da Silva (Student); I think mine was you
[00:47:53.16];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Simply don't see it wasn't
[00:47:56.07];unclear;There.
[00:47:57.48];Pamela; And it's gonna it's gonna have to do anything there. You do for
[00:48:04.35];Pamela; Me since I've been playing around, legally, they had around
[00:48:09.03];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So there were saying they like this because they like misnamed way she talks that they listen and then these are like these Alessi speaks like slowly.
[00:48:20.91];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Low so they understand better
[00:48:24.75];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And they feel comfortable
[00:48:27.24];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like stimulus. He feels comfortable in talking I say something wrong and English.
[00:48:33.27];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And optical in that nervous.
[00:48:38.25];smichaels; Does it help that you

[00:49:23.43];smichaels; ESL teacher and
[00:49:26.64];smichaels; a math teacher or a history teacher together.
[00:49:31.11];smichaels; Was it. Was it helpful that they got along, could you tell that they were friends and they liked each other. Did you think, do you think that that was partly that they work well together. Was that a part of
[00:49:45.81];smichaels; Me, could you tell that I guess.

[00:51:38.34];Naiara Da Silva (Student); is funny.
[00:51:40.89];Jessica Zaleski; Niagara is not in the geometry class.
[00:51:43.41];smichaels; Oh, just
[00:51:45.03];Jessica Zaleski; Know Pamela's not in it. Not none of
[00:51:47.22];Jessica Zaleski; These ladies are in the geometry class.

[00:53:56.46];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I agree to that have conversations like between us, our table. It's better than in a big circle with the whole class.
[00:54:05.43];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like she gets chai to get some nervous to talk in front of everyone. But on her table. She looks comfortable and sometimes when it's a big circle the whole class might get a little confusing like everyone sometimes everyone wants to talk and same time
[00:54:23.85];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And it gets a little weird. My RSA that she likes to talk like more alone.
[00:54:31.80];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Is awkward it soon so yeah I think small conversations like in small
[00:54:37.74];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Groups are better.
[00:54:41.97];Margaret Foster; That makes sense. I feel that
[00:54:46.98];Margaret Foster; Yeah, right. So I'm not now. Right. You said that you like working by yourself.

[00:55:23.10];Margaret Foster; We virtually curious about
[00:55:25.59];unclear;Um,
[00:55:27.87];smichaels; Well,
[00:55:29.64];smichaels; What we're curious about whether
[00:55:34.05];smichaels; Talking helps you learn about how that talking happens can be can be different. So there's partner talk, but there's also small group talk
[00:55:48.69];smichaels; Do you prefer one or the other. And there's also quiet no talk. So what do you think about what those different kinds of things do for you.
[00:56:02.76];smichaels; That's tricky.
[00:56:04.68];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); No.
[00:56:06.36];unclear;No.
[00:56:08.76];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Alpha Luke. He was like, he prefers numberless was
[00:56:12.81];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); A she was a sucky Lisa, I should have the same fundamental. This is a typical impulsive prophetic converse are known

[00:56:50.94];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So,
[00:56:54.84];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); My
[00:56:55.83];unclear;Face.
[00:56:58.80];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Because up as we gain my school will have a new lesson I was because I will say,
[00:57:06.12];Naiara Da Silva (Student); I am eating GMOs.
[00:57:08.46];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Also preparing for some retailer.
[00:57:12.57];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); To go because he
[00:57:15.48];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Saying
[00:57:18.96];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So they say they prefer small group conversations like not too many people that didn't listen better. Yeah, it gets a little confusing that ritual talking
[00:57:32.58];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So it's better
[00:57:34.14];sue snay; To kind of tag on to that.
[00:57:37.98];sue snay; When we had you working having a conversation in your table groups. So for people and then you knew we were going to have numbered heads.
[00:57:50.07];sue snay; That one of you was going to have to share
[00:57:52.95];sue snay; Did you feel better about being able to talk to each other before you did that. Did that help you prepare
[00:58:02.10];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And then we'll see coming in Chicago in the interstices done. Awesome. Is he, as in San Diego chicken a CG squarely on a motorcycle groups fella.
[00:58:15.87];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); It's a seat seat here to see animator arcandor he just had a conversation with each other. When we look at the boys, what

[00:58:54.27];Pamela; Depend on you.
[00:59:00.27];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So they say help when we knew one of those are going to be choosing
[00:59:06.39];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Because like iOS eight and a table. They don't really talk to each other. So there's the thing that like a familiar thing.
[00:59:14.58];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I'm going to fit. Anyway, someone so it was better when we knew it is better when we knew
[00:59:22.71];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); We were one of us are going to be chosen as we prepare
[00:59:28.32];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Dogs.
[00:59:30.09];sue snay; Okay.

[00:59:33.27];smichaels; Do you prefer partner talk just two people or a small group for people
[00:59:43.32];smichaels; Or both.
[00:59:44.79];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); But offended or by going
[00:59:47.49];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); To conferences, although it
[00:59:51.78];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Was too.
[00:59:55.11];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Okay, so we're divided. I don't care for me, can be both.
[01:00:01.56];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Prefers group.
[01:00:03.93];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Partner for
[01:00:06.45];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); All you do
[01:00:08.34];smichaels; Niagara say more about why you prefer partner because I I sometimes preferred partner to
[01:00:14.10];Naiara Da Silva (Student); So because she did, too. I did my homework. So everything is well with Bama so we
[01:00:24.33];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Were talking for two yes and no more easy
[01:00:33.15];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Isn't Brazil, we usually do partner.
[01:00:36.57];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Really yeah like there's sometimes during the whole year like
[01:00:41.64];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); It's really rare to have a group thing is usually partner.
[01:00:47.37];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); It's only group when it's a project mean to do at home and the maximum of people would like four or five
[01:00:55.53];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yeah. So I think we've got used to
[01:00:58.41];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Have last two people.
[01:01:01.02];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Work with
[01:01:03.18];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And I don't know, I like to do things alone to
[01:01:06.99];Pamela; Think that there's something here.
[01:01:09.48];unclear;And
[01:01:11.22];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); A lot of people prefer to do they like the word fund themselves because doesn't have that confusion, like I want to do that way. We're not going to do another way to smile.
[01:01:22.17];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So that can happen with us.
[01:01:25.86];unclear;Is
[01:01:27.48];sue snay; Also in that mindset that I like to do things myself because I don't have to rely on somebody else. The problem I have with that is
[01:01:39.21];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I don't come up with all the great is
[01:01:41.61];unclear;He
[01:01:43.77];sue snay; Comes up with and you all taught me that
[01:01:48.54];sue snay; Those things that you all came up with. I've been teaching biology for 20 years and you have come up with ideas and things I never would have thought of on my own. So I really have learned the value of
[01:02:05.10];sue snay; Making sure I get ideas from everybody else, whether I would prefer it or not.
[01:02:16.35];smichaels; Yeah.
[01:02:17.01];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); That's a good thing about having a partner or being a group of friends shares idea.
[01:02:23.25];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Was sometimes good to work on.
[01:02:26.58];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I don't really care if it's a group partner.
[01:02:33.33];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Right.
[01:02:36.78];smichaels; Did you feel like you could participate, just as well in a partner small group or the whole class or was. Were you
[01:02:48.15];smichaels; Were you able to speak as as comfortably across all those groups.
[01:02:55.11];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yes, I always
[01:02:58.38];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Feel comfortable speaking, if it is my life is like a whole class talking discussion or small group or partner. I always feel like I have something to say it would always wrong.
[01:03:14.88];smichaels; But Pamela, and they are. Do you feel that for you. It's easier to speak in the small group because you don't, you're not nervous or you're not.
[01:03:28.08];smichaels; Whatever. Do you feel like the small group for you was easier to talk and then the whole group.
[01:03:34.74];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Chicken my swastika samosa boo boo boo boo to converse us on our
[01:03:40.50];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Closest instruments, there was a person, some people
[01:03:46.26];Pamela; And
[01:03:47.82];Pamela; People management.
[01:03:50.61];Pamela; In really putting it into
[01:03:55.68];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); The same. Listen, I
[01:04:02.37];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Appreciate you know commerce.
[01:04:04.98];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Company field.
[01:04:13.98];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Is that you share my kids.
[01:04:17.73];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Don't
[01:04:19.80];unclear;Find though.
[01:04:22.05];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There's prefers the whole class.
[01:04:25.38];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Having a conversation because she doesn't really talk too much.
[01:04:31.02];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So to say so preferred whole class because everybody say something but Pamela says she prefers a small group like her table because she feels nervous, talking with everybody, but she feels comfortable talking with that small group.
[01:04:45.66];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Where they can understand her and she can assign them.
[01:04:51.81];smichaels; And you're in, you're pretty comfortable with both
[01:04:54.42];unclear;Yeah.
[01:04:56.28];smichaels; It's very interesting. It's really interesting so narrow, you're saying that even though you might not talk you like to listen to the ideas that that everyone else has. Is that right,
[01:05:09.06];unclear;Mm.
[01:05:10.53];smichaels; Hmm.
[01:05:11.91];Margaret Foster; That's interesting.
[01:05:13.35];Margaret Foster; Is there anything that we could change about the class so that
[01:05:17.16];Margaret Foster; You would feel like you did want to talk in the whole group.
[01:05:27.69];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Both reads
[01:05:30.96];smichaels; Right.
[01:05:31.92];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There's nothing

[01:06:19.98];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Cheaper
[01:06:21.36];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So keep it can be
[01:06:24.15];unclear;Equal
[01:06:26.70];Pamela; When I added some time, you know,
[01:06:31.95];Naiara Da Silva (Student); Coming.
[01:06:35.49];Pamela; Back Saturday.
[01:06:36.84];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Night. Thank you. So there were saying
[01:06:39.42];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); They would like like when there's a small group conversation.
[01:06:44.52];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); We so we could change like places change and six. So we could be close to someone that will understand us
[01:06:54.75];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); But like not not put everybody together like all the residents together because you've become an ass.
[01:07:02.64];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like put at least one person that will understand. Well, the other saying, and that would translate also
[01:07:11.43];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Be better when they will feel comfortable talking
[01:07:16.74];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like our side good sleepy but it doesn't really cut
[01:07:22.29];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Anything so
[01:07:27.15];Margaret Foster; I was actually going to follow. I was going to ask you. Yeah. Like did cuz I know you you like the seating changed a couple times.
[01:07:36.69];Margaret Foster; Did you like where you sat or like was one way better than the other or do you feel like it was helpful at all.
[01:07:44.85];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Um, I think the first time we've got moved
[01:07:49.77];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); From you me was better because I was far away from all the Brazilians, and I will send a pilot or no.
[01:07:56.61];unclear;No.
[01:08:00.12];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yeah, so there's no room. There was a really cool one without together, but we learned that didn't work really well.
[01:08:10.65];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So I think being close always one person that we have some kind of affinity. It's good.
[01:08:18.78];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); But not everybody can become less
[01:08:21.75];smichaels; Okay.
[01:08:24.30];smichaels; Yeah, I think, I think it's
[01:08:27.27];smichaels; Something to think about the
[01:08:29.58];smichaels; Group and the best kind of grouping with language, but also friendships.
[01:08:35.13];smichaels; All that stuff is is important.
[01:08:39.21];smichaels; Um, one thing I'm curious.

[01:08:48.87];smichaels; Or did you feel like it was important to to speak in English because there were anyway. I'm curious about that because a lot of this Spanish speaking kids would just speak a lot of Spanish in the class.
[01:09:02.79];smichaels; Yeah but but the Brazilian kids didn't do that quite as much and so I'm curious about did you feel. Did you did you feel okay about talking parties or what

[01:10:13.05];Pamela; And
[01:10:19.95];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I'm so we're, we're saying that we're like talking to Portuguese like talking to ourselves in Portuguese and when we're going to enter something
[01:10:30.99];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); One that knows English help the other talking English so we can learn
[01:10:38.28];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); We have small so small conversation which of these are really good.
[01:10:42.96];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Because we feel more comfortable to share ideas and
[01:10:46.35];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Send them another
[01:10:48.45];Pamela; Go this time.
[01:10:51.81];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); It does the native Spanish people
[01:10:56.76];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); They talk a lot.
[01:10:59.01];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Of Spanish
[01:10:59.67];Naiara Da Silva (Student); But they hide.
[01:11:03.75];smichaels; Why do you think that is
[01:11:06.69];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); But
[01:11:07.86];smichaels; That the Spanish
[01:11:10.26];smichaels; The Spanish students talk more in, you know,
[01:11:14.46];smichaels; When you guys
[01:11:15.87];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I think it's because
[01:11:18.96];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); We're part of the class. It's Spanish they talk in Spanish and like in English, not I think in our class and our period, those non Americans.
[01:11:31.92];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There is
[01:11:33.21];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); No, no, I think.
[01:11:35.73];smichaels; That might be true.
[01:11:37.02];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yeah, so we're divided, so it's it's kind of like
[01:11:42.12];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There are more Spanish people and they are the one to talk. Most and then there's Brazilian we don't talk to my sometimes you talk. And then there are some people like they from
[01:11:55.17];smichaels; Vietnam.
[01:11:56.40];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Vietnam. They barely talk
[01:11:59.82];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There are the ones I think from Africa.

[01:12:14.88];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Yep. Yes.
[01:12:16.71];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So they barely talk
[01:12:20.31];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Random message because I
[01:12:21.93];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); In Spanish, I understand a little bit. So they start talking about a topic and maintaining random things
[01:12:29.22];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); So it gets a little messy.
[01:12:32.04];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); They talk too much, too much.
[01:12:38.25];smichaels; So what would you do if you were the teacher would, would you invite all the languages in small groups and then and then try to get people to translate for each other so that we could share ideas. How, how would you, what would you do
[01:12:54.99];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); I think like, since it's for people like four per group.
[01:13:01.53];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); We could put like
[01:13:04.62];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); At least two from the same country.
[01:13:08.64];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like to get an amusing to Spanish
[01:13:15.09];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Because the Spanish, they're gonna be like
[01:13:18.72];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Model groups.
[01:13:20.67];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Like divide, but still have
[01:13:23.46];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); People that could talk with another with another one and send them. Yeah, so they wouldn't feel lonely or yeah
[01:13:32.25];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); There's, there needs to be a bridge person.
[01:13:34.80];smichaels; Yeah, as much as possible. Yeah. Pamela, and they are what, what do you think maybe I don't know if they understood
[01:13:44.40];smichaels; Did you understand what
[01:13:46.47];smichaels; What we just said.
[01:13:49.98];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); This is there a
[01:13:52.77];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Typical receiver, say for your professor conversation with GTA which group is perfect shade in the fall, at which of Coca Cola message boys in his eyes upon his when he was
[01:14:06.96];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Not for the same thing, something they know since 2000 euro dish, Angela.

[01:14:59.52];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And you'd like there's some wonder talking too much move them.
[01:15:05.64];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); And if they talk to my last up the whole time. So,

[01:15:32.34];Margaret Foster; That's just like maybe Sarah will disagree with my question.
[01:15:37.68];Margaret Foster; But
[01:15:39.27];Margaret Foster; What I'm most curious about right now is like, just like in the same kind of building on what we've been talking about.

[01:16:53.61];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); If we could use have description in English because she understand more when she's reading in English, then listening.
[01:17:02.22];Davylle Silva De Morais (Student); Reading and like sometimes when there's a lot of noise. It's also easier when there's description.
