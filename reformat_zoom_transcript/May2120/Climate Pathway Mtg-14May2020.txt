1
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:31.410
Margaret Foster: make major changes or whatever additions need to happen. Just make sure it can happen within the, the scope of a day. So kind of getting all that

2
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:44.760
Margaret Foster: Back into order for myself as well as to start making it so everybody's questions, concerns, comments, hopefully are getting addressed, and then we can hopefully next week, go through

3
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:59.460
Margaret Foster: Unit one and say this is at least where the most recent working draft that we all probably have some agreement on but need to go through and revise it should be pretty much ready then and then the segue into unit.

4
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.230
Margaret Foster: To

5
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.550
Margaret Foster: Which is going to be a little bit. I think it was great to talk with Nick, but then also thinking about where that bigger

6
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
Margaret Foster: Question, but that bigger conversation around what's the difference between data.

7
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:23.400
Margaret Foster: Big data and data and where that would fit in, because that's kind of like an anchor for I think unit to or a driving force, maybe not anchor with an appropriate way to think about it, but that's kind of where I'm at.

8
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.710
Margaret Foster: And trying to

9
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.180
Margaret Foster: Kick this there a draft or will there be a draft this in a Google Doc in our folder that that we can check on in the coming week

10
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
Margaret Foster: Yeah, there will be. I'm going to start to like I said, I'm kind of organizing it and getting it because I think

11
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:52.380
Margaret Foster: As TJ to has started develop some of these overview documents, I kind of want to have those in a place that leads to the storyboard documents. So things are kind of either in one place or

12
00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.200
Margaret Foster: organizes the bed. Yes. What I'm going to start to do because we have a lot of stuff and a lot of different places. And I just want to make sure that

13
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.330
Margaret Foster: Well, so I can focus on it, but so that everyone else can as well. So just kind of get some of that out of the way.

14
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.440
Margaret Foster: And then I think talking with TJ to I think last the end of last week just thinking about

15
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.370
Margaret Foster: Continuing with that like overview document as well. Like what's like a two, paragraph summary of unit one, for example, so something that we can all say

16
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:35.280
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I'm on board with that and then that's kind of our check to make sure unit one makes sense and segues into unit two and that if we have these

17
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.060
Margaret Foster: Are larger workshop goals and the NGS X principles and like the touch. We have a lot of different ways to start thinking about are we. Are we approaching

18
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.760
Margaret Foster: meeting those goals or, you know, like the the the

19
00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:05.760
Margaret Foster: Design principles, just to kind of make sure that we all can and look at it in about an evaluative way but that makes sense. So we don't always have to dig into the storyboard or whatever it is. And then the only other thing I'm doing is

20
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:18.570
Margaret Foster: Slowly taking out some of the really great conversations that we have, we've had that would belong in the facilitators matrix or something started to take some of those out because we've talked a lot about

21
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:33.900
Margaret Foster: The prompts, or more specifically, like the, why are we doing this. So just to make sure, like, hey, we're not setting participants up for a dead end. Here's our thinking in this step. So just to start not not making it nice and pretty or anything, but just to start

22
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:54.480
Margaret Foster: pulling some of those conversations we've had around some of the steps that will be great for facilitators to think about just starting to put it all into those places, some kind of organizational stuff and Wow, very, very important. I agree with you. We have a lot in our folder and

23
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.380
Margaret Foster: It needs some organization.

24
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.470
Margaret Foster: As you begin to think about a unit one and unit you guys going to unit to

25
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:30.570
Margaret Foster: I'm assuming we are we are going to begin to do the integration of some of the ideas from the curriculum that Ben has developed and pulling those integrating those into various steps so that that is evolving.

26
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:43.350
Margaret Foster: A lot, along with other sorts of activities or use of tools are learning about tools or modeling, whatever, whatever the other surround activities are going to be

27
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.600
Margaret Foster: Is that that. Yeah, definitely. I think the first step is kind of organizing and making sure everything's in a in a nice place.

28
00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:08.040
Margaret Foster: And then that's definitely a part of that layering and to make sure that either. You know, I know. Ben's working on it a lot to make sure that there's those those nice connections between the curricular units and the pathway and that will also I think once

29
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.880
Margaret Foster: Kind of have gone through everything and

30
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:27.510
Margaret Foster: Start putting all these pieces into place that will help us identify where those were those really strong connections are, you know, for example, because I think thinking even about caps and unit one. Like where can we draw a connection to, you know, like thinking about

31
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:39.300
Margaret Foster: The color ramping and math and everything and connect that to something in in Ben's unit and we didn't even put like a nice little placeholder in there and figure out how we're going to connect

32
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:53.910
Margaret Foster: Those two just seems like that kind of moving one forward to move the other one forward to move one forward to move the other ones, or is it is that it's sort of bringing it all along.

33
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.590
Margaret Foster: Together.

34
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.140
Margaret Foster: Rather than holding off the curriculum till the end. We talked about that.

35
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.340
Margaret Foster: several sessions ago yeah and then

36
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.160
Margaret Foster: Where are you

37
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:23.490
Margaret Foster: And what, what, how can we be helpful. All right. Um, I feel like I'm moving from this place where I've been thinking big picture about the curriculum and it has gotten sprawling and it's time to start figuring out how it could be

38
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:35.220
Margaret Foster: Tightened up because it would just take a really long time to engage in a curriculum that has everything that I've put in there in it and so

39
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.450
Margaret Foster: It would be really valuable for me to have feedback from you all about

40
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.430
Margaret Foster: Where

41
00:06:45.960 --> 00:07:03.810
Margaret Foster: I can take this kind of winding road and cut a couple of switchbacks. If you know what i that metaphor makes any sense. I'm a like I feel just about everything that's in there is something that I've, I've tested at some point in some of my

42
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.240
Margaret Foster: Some of my high school classes but

43
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:21.630
Margaret Foster: It would take, you know, I would take a half a semester to do this unit on climate as it's written, which is good. That's like, you know, that was my partly my intention is to, like, just put it all out there and then

44
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:35.070
Margaret Foster: Call the good stuff. But, um, that's one and that that's actually my biggest concern right now is like, wow, it all seems to fit so nicely. What do I pull out without

45
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:56.340
Margaret Foster: Without losing coherence for students, etc. And that probably isn't something that we can do by looking at it together. Right now it's just a request for folks to. I would love for another couple sets of eyes to take a look at where it is now and

46
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:05.520
Margaret Foster: And come back and just let me know thoughts on that I'll be that's I imagine what the next set of

47
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:26.400
Margaret Foster: Tasks for me is going to be. And then after that's done. Um, I think that the next piece is taking whatever the that pare down curriculum is as a storyline and start building out the materials that go with each experience so that

48
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:35.160
Margaret Foster: You know, I haven't put in anything in the curriculum like here's where I have a discussion. Well, you know, here's where I use

49
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:48.000
Margaret Foster: A here's where I am using gallery walks, here's where I'm engaging people in small group work or providing readings or anything like that. So,

50
00:08:48.600 --> 00:09:04.380
Margaret Foster: Um, so I think that's that's a step that comes after the kind of editing on the larger scale, so that I don't end up doing that for every piece of the curriculum, much of which may not end up in the final product.

51
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.390
Margaret Foster: An important question for me benefit could sneak in here is, are there.

52
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:28.860
Margaret Foster: I think it's important for us to kind of see this through your eyes as as the, the writer, the creator and are there. Have you been able to identify areas in the curriculum.

53
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:38.790
Margaret Foster: Depths in the curriculum that are kind of non negotiable. I mean, these seem like really strong anchor points.

54
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:56.370
Margaret Foster: And from which you are building forts a series of experiences or understandings. So I think it's just good for us to know a little bit more about your design thinking and

55
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.050
Margaret Foster: Yeah what those anchor anchor points or

56
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.320
Margaret Foster: What I was wondering too if the

57
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:14.250
Margaret Foster: Like all of the if all of the things that elements that are in the curriculum are are useful and things that you've tried and you feel like are important.

58
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:28.350
Margaret Foster: Maybe in to kind of step back from the open side model and the next gen storylines, like all that craziness, like those are so big and that they overwhelm teachers. I wonder if we do like

59
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:48.810
Margaret Foster: These three almost would Jane what you're just saying these three things are coming into focus as like these are key moments in the trajectory of the entire unit and maybe you only do the, you know, this is how I start the you know gallery walks, all of those elements, you know, the

60
00:10:50.670 --> 00:11:00.360
Margaret Foster: Discussion planning tool like all maybe it's like full detail on these three key parts and the rest of it can be more skeleton.

61
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:11.130
Margaret Foster: And so you're not, you know, you're not cutting. Good stuff. But you're just zooming in on these different pieces because if we think about that last unit. I think we're calling a unit for

62
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:26.370
Margaret Foster: Somebody might take something that, you know, it's still not fully built out and build it out in a different direction. And so maybe taking good you know something with good bones and adding their flavor to it.

63
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:37.500
Margaret Foster: And I think that would be that'd be very useful for a lot of people because because climate change is so overwhelming of a topic or climate, you know, with large

64
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.740
Margaret Foster: Yeah. Well, and that's an interesting thought like I

65
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.240
Margaret Foster: I kept imagining like having a package that wouldn't

66
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:58.590
Margaret Foster: I don't know. I kept imagining trying to pair this down to like two or three weeks of like period length classes and

67
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.490
Margaret Foster: I don't know that it doesn't seem to me like

68
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.070
Margaret Foster: This doesn't seem possible that you can get kids to a deep understanding of of

69
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.120
Margaret Foster: All of climate change in that period of time. It's just so enormous like I feel like

70
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.550
Margaret Foster: That

71
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.830
Margaret Foster: Maybe just showing the whole trajectory

72
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.600
Margaret Foster: That would take someone all the way there. And then just yeah I don't know what other people think about what to do, just said.

73
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:38.370
Margaret Foster: Level more thought. So, based on what you just said. The, the ambitious science teaching crew would 100%

74
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:49.050
Margaret Foster: Be on board with the two week like that's that's you know what their research has told them. That's what they said you know unit should be about two to three weeks. And that's it.

75
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:55.650
Margaret Foster: And but I also have been I was looking more at some grant funding around this. I don't know.

76
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:04.440
Margaret Foster: I don't know what I'm doing is a genius, probably more up your alley, but I'm just looking to see what out what is out there for, you know, new educational grants.

77
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:13.230
Margaret Foster: And was wondering that you know kind of with achieve and CSS falling apart. And it all going

78
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:22.290
Margaret Foster: To kick this work up. Yeah, it's all gone. The West and West Ed has so much money and. And so, you know, we definitely don't want another person.

79
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:33.810
Margaret Foster: In the you know saying we're going to do this and do this and cut that but I almost want to just have a conversation with the, I think it's three women that are the new

80
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:46.560
Margaret Foster: Directors of the end, you know, the new NGOs s and they're just from their social media stuff they're figuring out like they're not posting polished clean things and so

81
00:13:47.160 --> 00:14:04.500
Margaret Foster: I wonder if this might be something that they would put some generous funding behind because it's such a big project. And if that's something you know we're even interested in having a conversation about or, you know, eventually partnering with

82
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.560
Margaret Foster: With a group like that.

83
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:19.440
Margaret Foster: I said once once once we have I think there are a lot of spin off points. Once, once we have this

84
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:36.840
Margaret Foster: Halfway assembled and and i would have no problem with partnering with this. The western I've been looking at a couple of other foundations with that very idea in mind at the MGM foundation is one

85
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:57.630
Margaret Foster: So, but until we we kind of get some size of a pathway determined here, but people get a flavor or, as you said, TJ, I always like that expression, we've laid down some really strong bones.

86
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:15.780
Margaret Foster: And one can build off of those, you know, to make a longer arm or a shorter leg or whatever. But we need to get the whole but it's been a manageable whole to demonstrate

87
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:22.440
Margaret Foster: The what we what we're capable of doing and and then the partners will come to us.

88
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.920
Margaret Foster: Or we can go to them but ever

89
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.900
Margaret Foster: So,

90
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.180
Margaret Foster: I think it

91
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.990
Margaret Foster: I don't know what to say about the two or three week thing.

92
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.070
Margaret Foster: I think this is an awfully complex topic.

93
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:47.310
Margaret Foster: I guess I was thinking more like six now. Yeah, I was just going to jump in on that point as well because I think

94
00:15:47.910 --> 00:16:04.860
Margaret Foster: And I don't remember. It's been a little while that I reviewed the A ST book as well, and they're kind of approach. I think the one thing is that they use fewer core ideas or fewer science concepts to achieve that to three week time period. And I think Ben's unit would be

95
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:27.060
Margaret Foster: Multiple of those two or three week kind of units. So I, you know, like it's it's hard to think about a way to because it is short changing it, so maybe there is a little bit of a of a preface to it that you know these are are several you know either units are many units all all purposefully

96
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:39.090
Margaret Foster: Used if you're going to connect them and have enough time to cover all of it. And then you'll get these understandings. If you do something in two, three weeks, and you want to focus on the mechanisms.

97
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:48.690
Margaret Foster: Then you know this part, you know you focus on this sub unit this sub unit or that sub unit and that would also help us maybe think about

98
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:56.250
Margaret Foster: I know I think KJ before mentioned like that kind of spider web. And so if there's like a central starting place.

99
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:14.340
Margaret Foster: Which could be a shorter you know couple week unit. And then these other you know webs are pieces that go from, I don't know. It's all web these other lines are these other units or many units that you can then go do which bring you in all these different

100
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.300
Margaret Foster: Ways of thinking, which makes it super hard to write

101
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:35.790
Margaret Foster: A unit because if you're been thinking it's going to cover all of these things, then all of those ideas are being percolated or bounced around in the beginning and questions are coming up around that. So it's, it leads to a challenge. And I also emailed everybody

102
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:47.250
Margaret Foster: University of Washington someone there came out with this like 30 page document have a ton of links to a ton of different climate based

103
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:55.590
Margaret Foster: Units things to do with students activities simulations and I just shared it with everyone. Because then when you were like,

104
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:05.670
Margaret Foster: You know, maybe there's something in there. You can just grab really quickly for like a simulation or something that fits with what you're doing, not to add more stuff to you. It's super, super

105
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:15.990
Margaret Foster: Super long the table of contents is like eight pages and the rest of it is just linked, but it seems like it might be something that could come in handy. But

106
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.230
Margaret Foster: Sounds like a great danger.

107
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:28.680
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I think it is. And so it's pretty recent as well. So I didn't poke around in it too much because I would have got lost in there for hours.

108
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:41.430
Margaret Foster: But it seems like it could be something that has some use and it also might help us think about how other people are hopefully coming up with the same challenge. It's way too complex to do in

109
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:48.150
Margaret Foster: A few amount of weeks, so maybe that like some modular ideas will kind of come from that as well.

110
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.900
Margaret Foster: Just as as as an aside,

111
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:59.460
Margaret Foster: The State of Washington has a fairly large size.

112
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.010
Margaret Foster: Amount of money.

113
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:17.670
Margaret Foster: To give to school districts to begin climate science, science, especially at the high school level. So that makes sense to me that people would be up there, you know, sort of,

114
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:29.970
Margaret Foster: Doing these these aggregations as not really a deep, deep dive, but just at the resource level, but I think we're going for the coherence here.

115
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.410
Margaret Foster: And that makes a big big difference.

116
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.480
Margaret Foster: I think, I think the point then is

117
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:51.660
Margaret Foster: To help you and the project come up with

118
00:19:52.770 --> 00:20:19.380
Margaret Foster: Whether it's a module or our traditional or series of modules that reflect the curriculum or ways in which that curriculum comes into the pathway in very important in significant ways in terms of moving this construction of understandings around oceans climate in big data.

119
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:28.710
Margaret Foster: But yet, it doesn't overwhelm the teacher and and maybe there are, you know, I guess the spider.

120
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:48.540
Margaret Foster: Illustration is as good as any there's sort of a core piece of ideas and constructs that have to be there. And then there are these extensions that would give kids a deeper dive into some of those ideas, but that can be at the choice of the teacher.

121
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:59.310
Margaret Foster: Puts the bones are in that center part. But I think the hard thing is determining what our bones and what are extensions and it's hard.

122
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:16.680
Margaret Foster: Right well on that, um, the, the slides that I sent it out to everybody. Last week, right. We're WITH THAT. THAT WAS ONE LENS throws it through which I was trying to think about that very problem because

123
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:29.880
Margaret Foster: Each of those each of those Ben's in the pathway gives like teachers opportunity to jump deeper into all kinds of things.

124
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:38.130
Margaret Foster: The one that strikes me a lot is cellular respiration and photosynthesis are like they're critical understandings for

125
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:48.480
Margaret Foster: A carbon cycle model, which is the direction that I was taking that part of the curriculum, but

126
00:21:50.220 --> 00:22:00.900
Margaret Foster: I was trying not to like a life science teacher is going to be all over that they're going to they're going to be excited about taking that part of the curriculum going deeper there.

127
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.060
Margaret Foster: So I was trying to walk a line between

128
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:15.480
Margaret Foster: Making sure that students have in a solid enough understanding that they can reason about how carbon cycles through the living part of the environment.

129
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.160
Margaret Foster: But

130
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:28.110
Margaret Foster: Also, keeping the focus of like the focus of the unit here is the carbon cycle and not the processes of photosynthesis or cellular respiration, or any

131
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:38.700
Margaret Foster: Mm hmm. So, um, so I mean making those documents was useful for me. But I also think that they might like I'm hoping

132
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:48.540
Margaret Foster: That those documents or something like them would be useful to participants who are thinking about using parts of

133
00:22:49.410 --> 00:23:07.260
Margaret Foster: Or a good portion of or even all of this curriculum to see how it connects to their work and what they feel like their mission is in their classroom. Yeah, I agree with that. And that was what I thought we came up with as sort of a way of

134
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:22.050
Margaret Foster: Being useful to teachers who who are in a sense pigeonholed into particular areas of science, whether it's biology life science or science, you know, whatever. Right.

135
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:32.010
Margaret Foster: Which is a very, very different approach. And then we've used in NGS X, but I think it has a great deal of Barrett, it is more useful to high school teachers.

136
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:49.470
Margaret Foster: Yeah, so I just want to say before we shift gears, if that's what's going on on that. It sounds like what's most useful for me to do next is to really identify a

137
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.900
Margaret Foster: anchor points.

138
00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:02.370
Margaret Foster: Are the things that will both be the, the, the heart of the pathway. Okay, so it needs editing, but also the things that will be

139
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:14.130
Margaret Foster: Connected to and probably included in each unit of the pathway. Mm hmm. And then the second thing, it sounds like would be really useful is for me to think about how

140
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:22.110
Margaret Foster: This might be broken up into chunks that are meaningful in and of themselves that take

141
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:32.460
Margaret Foster: Somewhere in the order of two to three maybe up to six weeks but smaller chunks that would be that could be their own package.

142
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.310
Margaret Foster: So that

143
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:44.790
Margaret Foster: Is my second thing. And I guess my last question is, do the things that we want to weave into the pathway.

144
00:24:46.680 --> 00:25:01.410
Margaret Foster: Do we want them all from the same chunk, or is it okay if I identify things that seem to exemplify each unit really well, but might be spread more broadly through something that's bigger

145
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.650
Margaret Foster: And then a couple of weeks.

146
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:22.320
Margaret Foster: I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking more like the, you know, we, I feel like we have a we're matching each of the intro units to the expertise of the big allow folks and so

147
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:36.270
Margaret Foster: I i think there. I don't know that needs to be like a beginning, middle and end that are the three things that are highlighted it might be the things that are like the most compelling or the most are the

148
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.000
Margaret Foster: He

149
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.510
Margaret Foster: Introduces

150
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:50.790
Margaret Foster: You

151
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.530
Margaret Foster: Three days.

152
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.840
Margaret Foster: I think it's definitely not something I've seen done well and pathways that

153
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:13.080
Margaret Foster: Like, oh yeah, I mean you do this, this, this, and then all of a sudden you're here and you know you see every hand go up in the room with teachers like wait, how did you get finger like how did you get those posters and how do you get students to say those things and and and so I think

154
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.480
Margaret Foster: You know, like

155
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:27.180
Margaret Foster: I don't know that it needs like they, I think the teachers can see like, oh, we started here. It makes sense that we're zooming in on this piece now. And obviously, it'll take some playing around to figure

156
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:39.960
Margaret Foster: Figure out what that looks like and how we represent that. But there might be like these three key moments of, like, you know, using visualizations. To start off our thinking to like focus in on this unit.

157
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:52.080
Margaret Foster: You know, the second piece being like working with insane set of data and then being able to come up with new ideas for investigations and new ideas for moving forward.

158
00:26:52.440 --> 00:27:08.100
Margaret Foster: And then like how you put it all together. And so it does kind of follow the ANC framework, you know, of like kicking it off getting into the complexity of everything and then starting to put things together.

159
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.710
Margaret Foster: But I don't, I think it would be

160
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.850
Margaret Foster: I'm just kind of guessing I think for me it would be kind of interesting. If it was like, this is an example from

161
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:32.460
Margaret Foster: You know, one of the two week things. This is an example from a different one as an example. And I don't think it needs to be, but I like the idea of their of it being not overwhelming with multiple smaller

162
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:39.150
Margaret Foster: Whatever names for these things because I'm already getting confused. But like, it's

163
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.690
Margaret Foster: Go ahead. I just wanted it sounds like you're saying is

164
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:57.210
Margaret Foster: The right fit or that like pathway anchor point is the one that best matches the theme of that unit.

165
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.830
Margaret Foster: Right, Sam.

166
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:12.690
Margaret Foster: And the scientists what what they're bringing to that unit right so Kath with her visualizations and Nick with big data like tools. So, okay.

167
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:22.500
Margaret Foster: So rather than trying to compact it. Oh, you know, try to make it all work from a smaller piece. It's okay.

168
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:32.580
Margaret Foster: If it comes from other spots. Okay, that I can work with that. That's good. And I feel like it's almost like I keep thinking through the lens of like what question are we answering for participants.

169
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:39.810
Margaret Foster: I feel like at that point in the pathway, you know, at the end, towards where whenever it happens. Towards the end of unit one

170
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:46.860
Margaret Foster: It's gonna be like yeah cathkin do it because she's like super billion, you know, but my my kids can't do it, and then

171
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:59.640
Margaret Foster: You know, the next step is that that like this is how you know yes they're not writing algorithms for pictures from space. But they're doing this and this is how it's, you know,

172
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.320
Margaret Foster: Happening in classrooms, and I think it's almost answering that question every time.

173
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:14.400
Margaret Foster: Of, like, yeah, that's really cool. And like I as a participant and pumped and I've learned a bunch of content knowledge and I'm thinking more about different ways to do this. And I'm like, oh,

174
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:22.740
Margaret Foster: That is cool like that is how that plays out in the classroom, you know, through different you know structures or strategies or mechanisms or whatever.

175
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:38.100
Margaret Foster: But I get the answers certain tools that you know certainly don't have the sophistication that, you know, Ben T would use or calf calf with us.

176
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:52.800
Margaret Foster: But they get to the end point which is wanting that wanting the students to really grasp the concepts and what's the progression and the coherence what they're building and understanding towards

177
00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.420
Margaret Foster: I liked it did. Speaking of tools.

178
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:10.980
Margaret Foster: Did you all get a chance to play around with that big data tool or mechanism that Nick.

179
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.320
Margaret Foster: Provided for us. I thought that was really pretty interesting.

180
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:18.960
Margaret Foster: And

181
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:31.440
Margaret Foster: What's the kind of tool at a green size that students could use and make sense and understand this interaction of that.

182
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.150
Margaret Foster: I don't know what what you all thought

183
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:57.720
Margaret Foster: Can students use it. Absolutely. I think that that at least high school level. Um, and with coaching middle school students that they would need, they would needs some additional steps, probably to get in but high school students high school students are there, I think.

184
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:13.020
Margaret Foster: I find that great to hear. Because I think one of our, you know, our ideas when we met with with the scientist in December, is we were just so wild away.

185
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:28.020
Margaret Foster: With the various tools they had in their back pocket, and that's what we hope to be able to give to teachers and teachers and turn integrating what was realistic into their classroom so

186
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.020
Margaret Foster: I felt pretty good about that one. TJ and Chris your thoughts.

187
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:46.560
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I think this is the way anyway. Like, you know, this is exploratory data analysis. So this is really making sense of your data, kind of like one on one. But you can easily pick apart patterns based on if you do like

188
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:53.310
Margaret Foster: A dotted line graph, whatever, depending on what you put on the different axes. So I think this would be really

189
00:31:54.420 --> 00:32:01.620
Margaret Foster: At first it will probably look a little crazy and intimidating, but if we figure out a way to because this is, I think, exactly what we were talking about

190
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:10.860
Margaret Foster: As well. Like what kind of tools can we have people use to start making sense of have a huge

191
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:21.480
Margaret Foster: Data set and being able to not only identify patterns but get a little lost in it but feel a little bit more comfortable with a more robust question at the end, but still

192
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:29.190
Margaret Foster: Left with wondering a lot like I can mess around with it and do like gaps in temperature. And in my mind, say, you know what

193
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:42.540
Margaret Foster: I bet temperature is going to change as a function of depth and I can see it, but it still doesn't tell me everything I need to know. So I think they're, they're great, and to reduce a lot in a lot of places. And I think it's really just

194
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.930
Margaret Foster: You know, Excel done in a graphic user interface that you're really using

195
00:32:49.290 --> 00:33:00.720
Margaret Foster: Yeah but done but done and then engaging sort of way. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You don't have to get lost in the in the punching all the numbers and you can just mess with the it's very visual and very

196
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:08.280
Margaret Foster: I think that was very helpful for students. Oh, yeah. And I think it would be helpful for teachers to I know I heard a lot

197
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:22.650
Margaret Foster: Would from teachers that they're uncertainty just around these kinds of tools lead them to not introducing them to their students. And so this is this is a great opportunity, I think, to think about

198
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.180
Margaret Foster: When we're identifying areas within the unit.

199
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:37.530
Margaret Foster: It's not just to say, like, Hey, you know, like, these are some ways that you know you can think about implementing some of these approaches in the classroom. It's also here's some extra practice for you.

200
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:47.490
Margaret Foster: As a, as an educator, just a, you know, these are these are tools you can mess around with and feel a little bit more comfortable using them in the classroom. So

201
00:33:51.390 --> 00:34:05.580
Margaret Foster: Yeah I would echo, just like I think it helps with what we're talking about in you to to with the like talking about data is a different kind of thing like data is the backbone of science and you

202
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:15.210
Margaret Foster: It's not a picture in the textbook and I got a question that you have to answer. I think that's how most that's a lot of

203
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:29.640
Margaret Foster: Teachers, think about the, you know, a chart as, like, what's the right number that I need to get. Is it, you know, the x axis of this and the y goes to here and it's 32 and so most people freak out when they see that

204
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:43.740
Margaret Foster: That chart or the data table when they're like, whoa. Like, am I gonna have to grab this and I think the tuba like leaned into that and like, now you're just playing around, you just do this and you do that and I think that

205
00:34:44.850 --> 00:35:03.570
Margaret Foster: Is kind of what Nick was saying that like it's this, it's this Plato, you know, of data that you mess around with until you're like, Wait a minute. Now I have a question or I have a better question or now I'm noticing this one you know point thing that sticks out in this

206
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.980
Margaret Foster: Data set so i think it's it's a way of thinking about

207
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:10.680
Margaret Foster: Change.

208
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:25.860
Margaret Foster: Now we have access to so much data and so many people are overwhelmed and you know how many of these grants you read or you know they need a new computer scientists, you know, you're, you're studying.

209
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:35.010
Margaret Foster: You know, trees, and you need a computer scientist to help you sort through the amount of data that you're coming up with. And so I think it's an interesting

210
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:52.110
Margaret Foster: It's interesting that the the framework put such an emphasis on data and you know computational thinking and everyone's kind of scrambling trying to think about, like, Wait, how do we even do that. Where do we start everyone's like, instead of code robots.

211
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.650
Margaret Foster: Oh, cute robots.

212
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.300
Margaret Foster: Um,

213
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.240
Margaret Foster: I see that

214
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:08.370
Margaret Foster: I totally forgot what Cygnus say it'll come back. I'm sure it will come back.

215
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:21.960
Margaret Foster: This might be a good point to, to, like, maybe pause and think about the we were talking about with the coronavirus like because there's so much about. There's

216
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.300
Margaret Foster: The data, the graphs. I've been saving graphs that I see.

217
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:38.580
Margaret Foster: Where the y axis is all messed up, and it goes you know it's not linear. It doesn't actually have an like I've been sharing them with people, just to kind of see like

218
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:53.970
Margaret Foster: Look at this graph. And they're like, cool. It looks good, like now look at it like what do you notice like look looks fine. Well, that's what I thought. I mean, people I truly, truly, they're trying to understand

219
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.800
Margaret Foster: Flattening

220
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:16.320
Margaret Foster: You know, and, and what if this goes back up. But then, this comes down. I mean, what are we in a bad way. Now, is this a hot spot. What's the hot spot or. And so this has given us and challenging. It's challenging us and challenging teachers, I think, to

221
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.760
Margaret Foster: You know, I've been surprised in in

222
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:38.700
Margaret Foster: John's science class, there's been no right turn towards focusing on a coven as as as and the tools and science that are being used to help you know follow that data and understand it.

223
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:52.680
Margaret Foster: So I, you know, I'm thinking, why, why couldn't we develop several modules that would take the tools that we privilege in NDS like

224
00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:04.560
Margaret Foster: The kind of, well, and we're getting more and more tools tools that allow students to really play with data, but

225
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:19.800
Margaret Foster: With the n teachers to play with the data, but the outcome is since making this is what we want. Since making and coherence of data and especially when you have a lot of inputs into your data sets.

226
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:36.000
Margaret Foster: So I think I heard of it because it's such a think. So it's a triggering topic and I like, I don't think I got it until I was in my quantitative methods course in the doc program and

227
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:51.270
Margaret Foster: You know, my wife's younger sisters dying of cancer and every problem that we had was okay so 600 people have cancer and 40 of them died of cancer. And so, you know, everybody do the math of how many people died of cancer and literally

228
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:58.080
Margaret Foster: Every single one that he did and it was so hard to like get anything out of it because I'm like

229
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:06.210
Margaret Foster: He's talking about this human that I know that you know is dying of cancer. And so I think I know a lot of

230
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:13.260
Margaret Foster: Districts are thinking about using it, but I wonder about prescribing it or like how many people would sign on to it.

231
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:30.900
Margaret Foster: But I think it's worth putting out like a you know a few step module. And I don't even know what that would look like, like a half day pathway or something around but that's kind of what I wonder definitely wanted to wade into the water easily and not

232
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:51.000
Margaret Foster: go whole hog here with a big pathway, but perhaps develop a half day experience yet kind of framing it as like understanding. I was almost thinking practice eight like the obtaining evaluating communicating information like maybe if like because

233
00:39:52.260 --> 00:40:01.680
Margaret Foster: The first two pathways, you know, we're very focused on modeling explanation argumentation. And if we're thinking about data and we're thinking about mathematics and computational thinking

234
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.800
Margaret Foster: Why not go into practice eight and think, like, We're all being inundated with so much data.

235
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:16.680
Margaret Foster: And it's overwhelming. Like, it takes so much time to look at these graphs and think, like, wait, what is that even telling us, and

236
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:26.520
Margaret Foster: Even saying to me right Richard Chris and I were meeting and we were talking about modeling for the elementary pathway. And we were you know

237
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:33.690
Margaret Foster: Reflecting and kind of laughing at a sad way about like the way people are thinking about the models in

238
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:44.520
Margaret Foster: Right now for, you know, oh, this is the model, what's going to happen on the East Coast, but this is a model of what's going to happen when we open and that like I've got some very political.

239
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:54.540
Margaret Foster: Right leading people, and in the fam. And they are like, no, no. That models and have me. Where am I on that model. It's like, well, that's not what this model is and so

240
00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:08.310
Margaret Foster: I think we could do something that's maybe, you know, not specific. It's, it's about understanding on packing real, real life events or something, I don't know what the what we know what the name of it is, is it

241
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:14.190
Margaret Foster: It's related to the work that we're doing with Piccolo, in the sense that we're working with big data.

242
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:35.640
Margaret Foster: But that's another context is the pandemic context and it, you know, I can see there are all kinds of data sets from your back and and the Spanish flu. Oh, no. I mean, there's a

243
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:42.240
Margaret Foster: Vast amount of information to bring into a couple of modules.

244
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:51.420
Margaret Foster: But it's trying to you know what we're challenged to do. And in that climate pathway is to narrow this

245
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:59.550
Margaret Foster: So that the experience is just not like throwing spaghetti at the wall, but there's some real meeting here.

246
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:06.120
Margaret Foster: Right. Well, I think that's what I've been thinking about as you guys have been talking is what's the

247
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:16.260
Margaret Foster: I mean that the pandemics or public health data is just the arena that you're playing in it's not necessarily the

248
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:39.660
Margaret Foster: Surely the reason for being for the pathway. Right. Like, what is it, what's the, what's the thing that participants would get out of this pathway that makes it necessary, like what what understandings about three dimensional science or whatever is going to

249
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:46.050
Margaret Foster: Help us build other than just seeing it in a new context.

250
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:57.180
Margaret Foster: I'm, I don't know, but I think that that would be an important question for me to ask and answer before I felt like, Oh, I get what that's about, other than just the fact that it's

251
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:05.580
Margaret Foster: Happens to be about a current events you know about a some about something that's going on in the world right now.

252
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:12.690
Margaret Foster: And then I guess I I got to thinking about this because

253
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:34.110
Margaret Foster: It's it's around data literacy and how is day literacy being handled in middle school and high school today so that students who are going through this experience, and it's affecting them as much as it's affecting us as adults.

254
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:45.450
Margaret Foster: Have the ability to participate in a set of learnings in their classroom that helps them interpret their current reality.

255
00:43:46.590 --> 00:44:06.000
Margaret Foster: And I'm not saying every year. We're going to have a pandemic that these these kids are living through one, this is going to be part of their history as it is part of ours. And if you really don't under it's become to politicize so that for kids all they're picking up

256
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:18.630
Margaret Foster: Is the little is the politics of this rather than the actual interpretation of what's going on in the pandemic.

257
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.970
Margaret Foster: Brew an understanding and working with data points.

258
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:37.050
Margaret Foster: Don't think it's a really. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. I was gonna say, I think it's super tricky because of the relevance of it. And you know, I think, TJ mentioned as well that some people can be like

259
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:45.390
Margaret Foster: Like triggered by or it's already so prevalent maybe people don't want to talk about it. But it almost makes me think, like, if you're hanging out with a bunch of like

260
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:53.640
Margaret Foster: Baseball nerds, then they're going to talk about statistics as like a common language and understanding it, because it's a part of

261
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:03.480
Margaret Foster: The sport and, you know, they're kind of and it's like, it's the opportunity met the need to understand and so maybe it's a way to really think about

262
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.640
Margaret Foster: How often do we have a situation in life, you know, and we're in education, where

263
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:18.390
Margaret Foster: There's so much data being chucked at you in a short period of time and really crazy, different ways of looking at it, that's connected to what your what's happening at home.

264
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:28.530
Margaret Foster: It's connected to what's happening around the world, it's connected to all sorts of things that it it can really maybe it's the time to motivate us to think about

265
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:39.690
Margaret Foster: Data and understanding it in some way. And I don't know how you know if it's a half day or something. It's not like you're going to drill into everything but maybe if it's kind of like

266
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:54.540
Margaret Foster: How would you start to think about, you know, some of these current events or some of these of this data kind of volume that allows you to participate in the discussion. You know, so it's like a data literacy kind of

267
00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:07.740
Margaret Foster: not overly intensive, but like, what, what does the different what's, what's this image mean in this image mean if they're from the same day and talking about the same exact thing yet they're not

268
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:16.080
Margaret Foster: If I interpret them. They're not necessarily telling me the same thing. What kind of questions do I need to ask. So I can understand it in more

269
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:25.290
Margaret Foster: I guess detail, you know, and so when you're thinking about these models like some models are so complicated that if anything changes.

270
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:33.480
Margaret Foster: The, the validity of that model is no longer what it was when it like spit out of the computer and like that moment when it was like

271
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:46.320
Margaret Foster: Like a hot fresh bread out of the oven. It was really, really robust and reliable, but every minute after it might not be. And so what is that, well, it gets more stale and carry out your example.

272
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:52.380
Margaret Foster: The stay on this begins to set in. No, I just, yeah. So I love that and I think

273
00:46:52.980 --> 00:47:02.580
Margaret Foster: That that might be going off what you're saying. Chris, I like that spin that it's it's maybe it's a it's a data literacy and personal relevance piece because the

274
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:13.230
Margaret Foster: Everybody keeps talking about the, you know, quote unquote correct amount of time that you should be see looking at the news to get your daily news.

275
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:24.150
Margaret Foster: And and I think it'd be interesting to see like, what are you going, where do you go, where do you even start. What kind of, what is the news. What are you trying to get a pain for information.

276
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:31.680
Margaret Foster: And then I liked the baseball example. Like, I wonder if they're wonderful within this half day. And again, we

277
00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:39.390
Margaret Foster: Were always ambitious, but I want to within this half day we use code as the, you know, it's a personal relevance thing because it

278
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:53.010
Margaret Foster: Because it's forced upon us. And so it's not that, you know, we're going to spend in this whole pathway thinking about code. But we have to because it's affecting everyone. And so maybe that becomes the context.

279
00:47:53.400 --> 00:48:08.250
Margaret Foster: And then we use a couple of key sets of tools to then unpack some data set that is relevant to you and it might be something like baseball data or you know fantasy football or weather like the

280
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:21.780
Margaret Foster: Word on fire doc market or like surfing, like all the kids that were surfing and Delaware, like the their teachers were all saying, Oh, my God. They just want to know about the waves like fine like that's what they want to know about or

281
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:37.410
Margaret Foster: They'll stocking fish like it could be anything, and ended applies the same way no matter what they're focused on. And so maybe Kobe becomes the context and the tools allow us to connect to, you know,

282
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.330
Margaret Foster: We're all going to be impacted by data, you know, house markets or, you know, the

283
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:56.070
Margaret Foster: Unemployment like the you know all that like there's so there's so much data that's coming out of daily. And so I do like that. I would be interested in putting together working

284
00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:57.780
Margaret Foster: Like

285
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:08.970
Margaret Foster: It would have to be like NGS FX pathway concentrate or like we're gonna do this for half a day, you add the water and go outside. Make sure outside before you have to water.

286
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:18.390
Margaret Foster: It. And I think it's almost like dependent. And so when you think about all this coronavirus baby. The coven 19 data.

287
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:32.880
Margaret Foster: It really is getting up based on what your question is, it can help you go find like to do when you're talking about, like, what's the news. You want to go find out about, well, you have to have a question and then you have to know what's reasonably going to help you.

288
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:44.070
Margaret Foster: grapple with that question. It's not going to serve through all the top images on CNN or Fox News or MSNBC or wire. Those are all coming at you with a very specific

289
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:53.190
Margaret Foster: You know, statistical reason for introducing these data to you or even depending how you just even

290
00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:06.930
Margaret Foster: You know, if you use a logarithmic scale or just a temperature scale of Celsius is going to, you're going to have very different ways of interpreting what you're seeing, you know, and so like just just those little insights

291
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:19.170
Margaret Foster: Can be really, really useful. And so just be able, with the thermometer. The, you know, infrared thermometer on your forehead. We were like, oh my god, it's this number. What is, what is it supposed to be.

292
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:29.400
Margaret Foster: I don't know 28.2. Yeah. What is it like and you know they're talking about here in Connecticut about Mohegan Sun is, you know, on

293
00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:41.790
Margaret Foster: Land that they can do kind of what they want to do. And so they're going to open. They're going to open. They're going to change all their security cameras to heat cameras and so everyone's like, well, what he should I be what's my

294
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:54.150
Margaret Foster: Feet. It's like, that's not the question like what is. And so I think everyone is struggling with it and it is, it would be interesting to put it out there and I will

295
00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:02.670
Margaret Foster: As I model this over. I think one of the reasons that this

296
00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:12.690
Margaret Foster: You know decisions that governors are making decisions that date representatives are making our mayor's are making or business people are making

297
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:31.260
Margaret Foster: Have become so politicized is that I don't know where they don't know what else to put out there in terms of what they're basing their decision on and they're not basing in many instances to not making basing their decision on understanding what the data is telling them.

298
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:32.940
Margaret Foster: It's

299
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.030
Margaret Foster: I find this all a little scary.

300
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:41.640
Margaret Foster: Well, I think. So if we can pump a little data literacy

301
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.500
Margaret Foster: Into the world in our, our particular way of doing it.

302
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:57.990
Margaret Foster: You know, why not, I think, I think it's like, as I've been listening to everybody. The first, my first thought is, this is huge. There is so much to

303
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.610
Margaret Foster: data literacy, which is one of the things that makes it so challenging

304
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:14.040
Margaret Foster: I wonder like what it is that you do in half a day that makes it really valuable like that would that'll be a really interesting question to figure out like

305
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:28.470
Margaret Foster: What can you give people in that short period of time. It's going to actually I think it has to be more than a half a day. I'm sorry. I think it's a day, right, we just find you know where to be the facilitator and

306
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.190
Margaret Foster: Just talk really fast.

307
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.940
Margaret Foster: Micro Machines. You guys remember those

308
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:56.790
Margaret Foster: So, but I think like that. It's a really interesting question. And I think it's really important because as Jeanne was saying like, I think this is where I public trust in science is either forged or lost, right, because

309
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.710
Margaret Foster: Uh, when people feel like

310
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:18.630
Margaret Foster: A thing is it's the things that I heard when I was I was growing up about nutrition and science. It's like, oh, they just keep changing their minds first butter is good for that it's bad for you, then you're supposed to eat margarine and now margins bad for you again.

311
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:28.650
Margaret Foster: You know, just wait five minutes, and all of a sudden, whatever you're doing will be healthy, right, like you have that that mentality and I can totally see where that impression comes from

312
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.780
Margaret Foster: In in people. And I also

313
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.630
Margaret Foster: I don't know i think i think it's

314
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:44.760
Margaret Foster: I think it's ambitious and good, but like I really curious to see where

315
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:58.860
Margaret Foster: What you could do in that space of time. That would give people something actionable that they can take back to classrooms that would help to advance that I was also really thinking that what

316
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:09.810
Margaret Foster: what Chris was saying strikes me as it's like the opposite problem that we're thinking about in the climate pathway.

317
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:23.850
Margaret Foster: Because in the climate pathway we have these enormous data sets that are raw the raw data. And so we're trying to just poke around in them and see what kind of meaning comes out of them like

318
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:37.470
Margaret Foster: You know, temperature versus depth. Hey there, it seems to follow a pattern, but there's this anomaly over here like maybe we should investigate that like that, is that that's what we're doing in the climate pathway.

319
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:47.520
Margaret Foster: But if you do that with the data that comes to you through USA Today is not going to be very productive and like Chris was saying like

320
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:59.130
Margaret Foster: Porton sometimes in those contexts to really start with a question so that you can read that data, which has already been digested much more critically

321
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.990
Margaret Foster: Like, that's something that feels like it's got firm footing to me.

322
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:11.610
Margaret Foster: And thinking about, like, kind of the whole. It reminds me of doing a research proposal.

323
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:18.570
Margaret Foster: Back in like grad school when I was writing grants you go and you you're you're looking through other people's methods.

324
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:22.620
Margaret Foster: In their in their published papers and you're looking for their

325
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:34.680
Margaret Foster: Their research question because you want to pull something from it. That's useful that supports you know you found this gap in our understanding and other people tried, but they fell short because maybe they didn't

326
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:47.550
Margaret Foster: Sample over enough months and you're saying, you know, I want to sample more maybe less frequently. But over more months. So I'm going to provide this as value to this, this, you know,

327
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:56.970
Margaret Foster: This body of research, though, it's almost at to borrow from what you're saying, Ben. It's like, so that's an intuitive tool set that maybe

328
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:02.520
Margaret Foster: I've developed over time. I didn't start with it, but it's very natural to say

329
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:14.250
Margaret Foster: Let's start with what question am I thinking about where did this data come from what question. Were they thinking about you know what time frame, was it collected people already publishing, you know,

330
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:25.620
Margaret Foster: Research papers that say, you know, based on three weeks of sampling certain people, we can say this about coronavirus spread and so like those are really

331
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:38.730
Margaret Foster: You know, how can we come up with those really thought provoking questions, almost that people can then start to I guess maybe answer on their own or start to build. Just a little, little bit of that mindset around

332
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:44.940
Margaret Foster: Maybe even it's just as what is your question, because as TJ said to thinking about, you know, like in

333
00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:57.900
Margaret Foster: The sports world there's millions of ways to make this relatable and I'm sure in the stock market world there are as well. You know, people are always coming out with new ways to combine different variables to tell you some sort of

334
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:01.560
Margaret Foster: Rating System for something, you know, and so

335
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:12.630
Margaret Foster: Why don't we try to figure out how we can extend that toolkit or that little lens to other folks because I do agree and with the butter question. It's almost like the first thing I asked as well.

336
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:24.930
Margaret Foster: Who did they study, you know, right, because butters really good for some people, you know, or when they say like we did a phone call interview to determine which governors have a high approval rating.

337
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:38.010
Margaret Foster: And they called the same they called a set amount of people and in certain states they can say it's statistically significant, but in some states they they say it's not statistically significant. So

338
00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:49.410
Margaret Foster: How many people did they even have to call you know like they've never called me. But, you know, like so. It makes me wonder. There's a lot of simplified questions out there like there's a lot of simple ways people are presenting things that

339
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:56.550
Margaret Foster: We might be able to to draw in but I don't know, it's a lot to think about in three hours or four hours.

340
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.620
Margaret Foster: Before date is

341
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.700
Margaret Foster: Here 10 or 10

342
00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:17.460
Margaret Foster: I am wondering if people, people know I'm the cognitive sciences Daniel Willingham

343
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:33.270
Margaret Foster: He's um he wrote a book that was very interesting to me a couple years ago called when can you trust the experts. I dropped a link in the Minutes to it if anyone's interested but this has been thinking about that a lot.

344
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:44.160
Margaret Foster: He doesn't from the perspective of a teacher, trying to look at educational research. But if they're just the questions that come from science in public use all the time.

345
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:54.630
Margaret Foster: Which are, you know, how do I as somebody who doesn't have the background in a particular field and don't know

346
00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:03.900
Margaret Foster: Like, what's it what what are the important constants are controls in a in an experiments even um or

347
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:17.610
Margaret Foster: What constitutes a sizable data sets and the given context of what we're talking about. One of the things he points out is that, like, the reason that we have experts in so many different fields.

348
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:34.260
Margaret Foster: Is because it takes a long time to get to know the mistakes that have already been made in that field, right, you have to kind of recreate the process of making those mistakes yourself and Hello there.

349
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.850
Margaret Foster: And

350
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:43.290
Margaret Foster: And so he puts forward and arguments in that particular book about

351
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:52.920
Margaret Foster: How everyone at some point asked to take responsibility for being a part of a scientist in that conversation.

352
00:59:53.370 --> 01:00:02.700
Margaret Foster: And then at some point you have to recognize that you're not going to be able to get a PhD in the subject and won't be able to be as critical a reader in it or a scientist in it.

353
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:16.590
Margaret Foster: As other people are going to be able to be and that is a really interesting tension. I think when you're talking about this science and engineering practice.

354
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.950
Margaret Foster: Because eventually

355
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:23.850
Margaret Foster: At some points you're

356
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:32.580
Margaret Foster: Like I have to consume data that somebody else with more expertise is digested and I can be critical of it to a certain point.

357
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:38.520
Margaret Foster: And then I've brands, the limits of my own time. So,

358
01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:46.950
Margaret Foster: I think something in that pathway that addressed questions like that would be really interesting.

359
01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.480
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what it would look like, but it would be, it would be right. Really territory.

360
01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:06.930
Margaret Foster: Agree. I just bought that book. And I feel like I need to have less meetings because I just got the book from Nick from our last meeting just arrived steal like an artist, my pile is growing.

361
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:13.380
Margaret Foster: Well,

362
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:22.350
Margaret Foster: I really, really appreciate you putting your minds and voices to this discussion, I

363
01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.670
Margaret Foster: I think we want to wait into this carefully.

364
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:31.170
Margaret Foster: But at least I'm sensing

365
01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:39.360
Margaret Foster: At this moment in time as we leave this conversation is it that the three of you have interest.

366
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.640
Margaret Foster: In pursuing a something that's not too big.

367
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:51.900
Margaret Foster: That is in, in many respects, has a very practical overlay for teachers.

368
01:01:54.690 --> 01:02:00.960
Margaret Foster: And if I can't. I really can't see it as being any less than a day.

369
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:02.460
Margaret Foster: And

370
01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:19.440
Margaret Foster: I think we should continue to turn the silver in our minds, and I think I can get funding for this. I really do. Because I think it's been a topic that just no one is picking up

371
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:32.220
Margaret Foster: And Jim, you know, I wonder if it's even a neat opportunity to think about if it is even a day. What's that day look like maybe it's an hour than two and a half hours then two and a half hours with a little bit of

372
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:44.520
Margaret Foster: You know stuff happening in between or stuff before. Who knows, just to kind of maximize that time if it's going to be done current in the current environment and done virtually versus an in person.

373
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:56.790
Margaret Foster: You know, well, that, that, that's it. I mean, we don't know whether we'll be back face to face in the old NDS sex way.

374
01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:05.730
Margaret Foster: But you know we talking the next four months. But Ben and I were talking about this before you joined us. And the fact that

375
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:12.300
Margaret Foster: John school is planning graduate high school graduation for seniors in August, but

376
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.700
Margaret Foster: You know, who knows.

377
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.340
Margaret Foster: Who knows, we need a model, we need a model. Yeah, really.

378
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:27.510
Margaret Foster: Yeah, she here right girl and I put in the in the Minutes.

379
01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:38.820
Margaret Foster: The USF grant that Laura's angry and pray Sadler got around building curriculum materials for I believe it's just for high school students.

380
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:48.600
Margaret Foster: High school students and they started building out modules and got one of those rapid NSF grants.

381
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.230
Margaret Foster: Ability. I think that

382
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.130
Margaret Foster: What we're turning around here.

383
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:04.290
Margaret Foster: Could be a rapper, which is yes that's well that's how we got started.

384
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:12.960
Margaret Foster: Was through rapid grants. So, but we, I don't want to take our attention away from climate.

385
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:31.830
Margaret Foster: But all of this takes a little research. I have a couple of names. Now, at age that are working on developing these sorts of courses, not necessarily for k 12 or middle and high school. It's but

386
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:44.850
Margaret Foster: For for educators, so I'll see what I find out there and bring it back to the discussion. Are we having a little something to eat there Lily.

387
01:04:45.480 --> 01:05:03.330
Margaret Foster: Yes. Is that what you're wearing on your chin, you know, yeah, she had a little yogurt snack and she's getting better and better at the spoon and the end the fork and now she refuses to let anyone really theater, unless it's like myself, you're close to bedtime. Yeah, yeah.

388
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.140
Margaret Foster: I sometimes, it ends up in other places.

389
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.270
Margaret Foster: Okay, so just just to review.

390
01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:27.060
Margaret Foster: Then, do you want to go back through and and find those anchor points and share that kind of analysis with this before we

391
01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.160
Margaret Foster: Get in looking at the curriculum and sort of

392
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:45.510
Margaret Foster: Coming to that at least individual decision before we get back together about what seems to us like the non negotiable that could go in to

393
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:52.110
Margaret Foster: The pathway or you a uses stepping up points.

394
01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.430
Margaret Foster: In some way that

395
01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:10.860
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I feel like you need to give us a little bit more direction on what on what you would like us to do. And if you want to do some work first do it and then shoot a note, our way.

396
01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.910
Margaret Foster: Okay, so let me. Um, how about this. Yeah. What about like by

397
01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:28.920
Margaret Foster: Tuesday. What if I sent you a list of potential List of potentials. So, and I try to match them up by unit.

398
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:45.990
Margaret Foster: And I'm with the thinking about the expertise of our scientists guides for each unit and trying to match those and I'll try to send I'll try to send a couple for each so that

399
01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:56.520
Margaret Foster: As people are thinking about it. You might suggest one or what are the advantages are of one of those over another. Does that sound.

400
01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:01.470
Margaret Foster: Oh dear.

401
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:20.370
Margaret Foster: Are you okay with that Chris Yeah, that'd be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And Chris, you're gonna do some organizing for us and send up a flare when that's ready. Yep, yep, or we'll go through it together next week.

402
01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.580
Margaret Foster: And TJ, you'll just be

403
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:40.170
Margaret Foster: Too, too. Okay, like I want to get at least the detail that we have in Unit one and hopefully by next week and get into unit three. I'm looking forward to, you know, our meeting tomorrow to start

404
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:50.820
Margaret Foster: You know, plug in some seeds for the what that story is because I think that's the one for me. That is the most foggy

405
01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:57.090
Margaret Foster: Because we, you know, we definitely need to wrap things up. We'd show how to build

406
01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:09.240
Margaret Foster: An explanation or an argument and put things together, but I feel like Ben tease work is so complex, not that, you know, Catherine Nick's isn't

407
01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:19.440
Margaret Foster: But you know, I think, from because he's doing science and it's and at the director role and so like I i wonder

408
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:40.650
Margaret Foster: I'm kind of hopeful that there is a story in there of like the things that he thinks are important to figure out and share. And I think that would be a nice wrap up to the big low work that like he will put in for these larger grants to say these bigger stories because he thinks that

409
01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:56.820
Margaret Foster: I don't know. Uh, well, I don't know what he thinks. But I think there's like a if there was like a if this is so important than I'm going to do this, then that might be like a nice way of building towards something bigger than a car and

410
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:09.720
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I'm looking forward to just kind of thing. What he says it's almost like a claim evidence reasoning critique and there's going to be other parts that are going to be involved. I think because a big

411
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:19.890
Margaret Foster: Point is going to be like, how do you know what you did was was any good. How do you know what other people did was any good. And then how do you convey all of that to folks. So I'm interested as well.

412
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:28.740
Margaret Foster: I'm interested in when his work interfaces with MCS or with caps.

413
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:35.010
Margaret Foster: And so we can begin to get a little bit of that, you know, cross fertilization.

414
01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:43.380
Margaret Foster: interaction among the three scientists more visible and in in the work.

415
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:54.660
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I don't think I thought of that, like the overall. Maybe we need something that's like all of the the community of Bigelow.

416
01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:07.290
Margaret Foster: And like, how did they, how do they work together and build off of each other if if they do, and then how does that mirror the kind of work that we want happening in in 6612 classrooms.

417
01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:15.960
Margaret Foster: Yeah, I think, I think that that's the video that we need to make up for them having that conversation and

418
01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:23.670
Margaret Foster: That I need to hear a little bit more about Ben's work tomorrow, and I'm not real clear on it. I'm not real clear on it.

419
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:40.380
Margaret Foster: Okay. Hey, thanks so much these these these are speaking of anchor points. These meetings are truly anchor points for me. So yeah, OK, we'll see in the morning.

420
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.320
Margaret Foster: morning or the afternoon.

421
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:47.310
Margaret Foster: Thought it was early. Yeah, I thought it was

422
01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:49.560
Margaret Foster: All right.

423
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.690
Margaret Foster: I'm gonna

424
01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:54.360
Margaret Foster: check my calendar. Yeah.

425
01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:00.000
Margaret Foster: Yeah okay we'll see in the afternoon. All right.
