00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.230
Margaret Foster: Can get in there doing my best.

4
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.940
TJ McKenna: We can do

5
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.990
Yeah.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.670
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

7
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.640
TJ McKenna: I thought the best quote that I

8
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.190
TJ McKenna: reshare it on Instagram.

9
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.120
He

10
00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:03.810
TJ McKenna: Says this idea of slowly reopening has the feel of letting my kindergarteners choose their own partners, there'll be very clear directions given beforehand, lots of examples, but pretty soon we're all going to come sit back down on the carpet.

11
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:23.970
Margaret Foster: I saw another one back closer to the beginning of everything, where somebody was like, uh, I feel like I'm back in kindergarten and we're losing recess, because not everybody can like stay inside and sit down.

12
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.990
Yes.

13
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.490
TJ McKenna: Totally

14
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.170
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

15
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.120
Margaret Foster: So,

16
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.650
Margaret Foster: How is your other work going and stuff.

17
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.500
TJ McKenna: It's pretty crazy. It's

18
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
TJ McKenna: It feels weird that grades are and and submitted and now I have more work.

19
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.750
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

20
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.890
TJ McKenna: We're coming from

21
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.970
TJ McKenna: Yeah.

22
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.190
TJ McKenna: That doesn't say no to it.

23
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.330
Margaret Foster: Yeah, an important no

24
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.130
TJ McKenna: Yeah, I don't have that one yet.

25
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.160
Margaret Foster: Working on it. But thank you for making time to do this today. Yeah.

26
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.770
TJ McKenna: Yeah, that would be fun.

27
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.840
TJ McKenna: I showed you my newest addition.

28
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.850
Margaret Foster: Now,

29
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.320
TJ McKenna: So my wife had bought me this one.

30
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.950
TJ McKenna: And

31
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.510
TJ McKenna: Like people can see it.

32
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.560
Margaret Foster: Huh.

33
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.420
Margaret Foster: I, Cindy. Hello.

34
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.770
Cindy Kern: How are you guys

35
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.350
TJ McKenna: Just sharing my newest addition with Maggie.

36
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.940
TJ McKenna: On my dead stuff wall.

37
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.270
TJ McKenna: And so I needed a new addition to my wife bought me this one.

38
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.050
Cindy Kern: Okay, nice.

39
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.190
TJ McKenna: Nice. I didn't realize

40
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:43.080
TJ McKenna: Until director at BU said TJ, my favorite. I think is the one that says I don't give a rat's ass and like you can see that from here.

41
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.980
TJ McKenna: Was I replaced it with this. It's a row. Dear from England. And so this is David really

42
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.350
Cindy Kern: Nice.

43
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.510
Margaret Foster: I like that. Okay.

44
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.770
TJ McKenna: Pretty excited about it.

45
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.790
Cindy Kern: I would have left the rat's ass one up.

46
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.440
TJ McKenna: I just was meeting with so many students and her as the director. It's like student services. I was like, I think she's telling me to take that down.

47
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.660
TJ McKenna: That's a nice subtle way. I like that one. TJ. Okay.

48
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.060
That's hilarious.

49
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.540
Margaret Foster: Oh dear. Yeah.

50
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.930
Cindy Kern: I see you have quite the collage behind you, as well.

51
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:35.130
Margaret Foster: I do. Um, it's all the stuff from the internet. I printed out before the internet became a wasteland, you know,

52
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.560
Margaret Foster: Yeah, like back when artists sites were anywhere except Instagram.

53
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.990
Cindy Kern: Stuff like that. Okay. Okay.

54
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.060
Cindy Kern: Very nice, very nice.

55
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.870
Margaret Foster: Yeah, just the stuff. Yeah, you can check

56
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.540
Cindy Kern: I

57
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.150
TJ McKenna: Haven't I thought you'd have a chicken on each shoulder

58
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.420
Cindy Kern: Well actually the reason I'm running late is

59
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.570
Cindy Kern: Without loose so my husband and I were were convincing her to head back to the enclosure and the coop so

60
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.160
Cindy Kern: Yeah.

61
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:20.610
Cindy Kern: They're, they're, they're a wily little group for being two months, not even I guess just two weeks, two months old yesterday, so uh yeah they're keeping it real, but keep it real.

62
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.960
TJ McKenna: There definitely, yeah.

63
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.330
TJ McKenna: The closer you get to raising them, the more you're like these are tiny dinosaurs that just wanted

64
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.500
TJ McKenna: Yeah, everything

65
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:50.310
Cindy Kern: Yeah, we, you know, this is our. This is what this is our fourth flock. And I guess five years. No, I guess. Our, our third flock and five years because our my son's junior and senior year. We didn't do we didn't raise babies. Just because his sports schedule was too insane.

66
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.740
Cindy Kern: So,

67
00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:06.570
Cindy Kern: This we have 16 because usually about 25% them into being roosters and we have to we have to find them a home that's not in North Haven, because we're not allowed to have roosters in North Haven.

68
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.370
Cindy Kern: So we only appear to have one rooster and he is so dinosaur so

69
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.420
Cindy Kern: In everything that he does, it's, it's so much

70
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.430
Cindy Kern: He's a jerk and so much fun at the same time. So, yeah.

71
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.330
Cindy Kern: You're crazy.

72
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.950
TJ McKenna: Sweet mouth when they find a mouse and just fight over it rip it to shreds.

73
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.870
Cindy Kern: Yeah, I'd like the Chipmunk that goes in and out, out of the enclosure.

74
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.580
Cindy Kern: It's funny to watch and go like

75
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.090
This

76
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.420
Cindy Kern: Like a chipmunk or the chickens go

77
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.670
Cindy Kern: And they eyeball them with one I

78
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.160
Cindy Kern: Think. Oh, he's out

79
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.460
TJ McKenna: Against

80
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.460
Cindy Kern: The dinosaurs. Yep. Yep.

81
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.410
Cindy Kern: Oh man way they run

82
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.090
Margaret Foster: Just so I could have chickens, especially

83
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:11.190
Margaret Foster: Is, but I do want a cutter and make sure that we spend lots of time on on this so that we can all get back to our baby dinosaurs imaginary

84
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.250
TJ McKenna: Maggie, nice.

85
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.060
Cindy Kern: To control TJ my

86
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.370
Cindy Kern: Southern a while.

87
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.690
Margaret Foster: Before that, like, I would love for this to be a nice conversation like

88
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:36.930
Margaret Foster: We're, we're writing this paper with gene that we've talked about before. Um, and the, what are the gaps so we kind of notice was or at least personally I don't know a lot about new terrain.

89
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:44.640
Margaret Foster: Or like how that informed projects saying or what effect that had on the rest of the ecosystem of Connecticut education.

90
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:57.300
Margaret Foster: And so the purpose of this meeting is kind of both to have a fun conversation about baby chicken dinosaurs, but also to just kind of try to fill that gap in a little bit.

91
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:05.910
Margaret Foster: And thank you both so much again for taking the time out of your busy schedules to do this right now because I know things are crazy.

92
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.150
Margaret Foster: So yeah, and I'd love to kind of start off just like what

93
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:26.070
Margaret Foster: Why did you apply to new terrain like what brought you to that experience where you like submitted your application. What was your vision for you were like, I'm going to this out of this professional development experience. What did that look like for you.

94
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.850
Cindy Kern: Oh for TJ.

95
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:48.690
TJ McKenna: So, mine was kind of weird. I was being asked to do inquiry training and tried to get into new terrain via pen crooner and gene said no we don't need informal science educators in this. This is for

96
00:08:49.710 --> 00:09:08.340
TJ McKenna: IT folks and this is for formal classroom teachers. And so I ended up going through Holly Carrick who I was, the scientist in residence at the stem Academy and Windham and Holly said any project that gene Moon is associated with is going to be an awesome project.

97
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:20.550
TJ McKenna: And so I joined as a elementary wind up teacher which gene and Sarah and Brian all still laugh about, to this day, because I think I still have my thing here that says

98
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:30.900
TJ McKenna: Elementary Wyndham teacher and I was so nervous that somebody's going to call me out and be like, I'm actually the principal there and you don't work there and get out, get out of here.

99
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.560
Cindy Kern: Yeah, I can't imagine any nervous about anything.

100
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.460
Margaret Foster: Okay. Oh, sorry.

101
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:50.190
Cindy Kern: Oh my mind was, I literally had just moved to Connecticut from Las Vegas and I had been here for

102
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.740
Cindy Kern: Oh,

103
00:09:54.150 --> 00:10:02.760
Cindy Kern: I think it was new terrain 2013 2014 or was it 2014 2015 and 20 1314 right

104
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.940
Margaret Foster: I'm

105
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.920
Cindy Kern: Pretty sure it was 20 1314

106
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.380
Cindy Kern: Because I I had

107
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:25.230
Cindy Kern: Actually, I think it's 20 1415 I had just been here and I was in my first year and I think it was Bonnie Mauer I want to say Bonnie Mauer was the one that reached out to me and said,

108
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:46.680
Cindy Kern: We want to get all i cheese involved in this, you know, please, please find a blank number of teachers to work with invite them to come along. I couldn't even find my house without Google Maps, let alone. Could I say that I knew any teachers.

109
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.010
Cindy Kern: In the classroom I had only started to get to know the pre service teachers at that time.

110
00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:06.210
Cindy Kern: I reached out to a colleague within my school and said, Can you help me out. I would like to do this, but I need three or five teachers to do this with me.

111
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.660
Cindy Kern: She rounded up teachers for me and then

112
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:23.070
Cindy Kern: Yeah, that's, that's how it happened. It wasn't, it was my my head was spinning way too much in that first year to say that I was actively looking for

113
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:31.170
Cindy Kern: I was actually actively looking for anything. It came to me, which I'm extremely grateful that it had come to me.

114
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.410
TJ McKenna: And where you at, where you have you ever seen the haven that I got the time

115
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:46.740
Cindy Kern: I was, I was a tenured professor at UNH at the time. So I had taken over for

116
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.370
Cindy Kern: Why am I all of a sudden blanking on her name.

117
00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:01.650
Cindy Kern: She worked with the IT group for a long time, she went back to the classroom. She was at set Southern Kathy.

118
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.480
TJ McKenna: Oh, I know you're talking about

119
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.980
Cindy Kern: Kathy.

120
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.320
TJ McKenna: Who did the she did triathlons

121
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.820
Cindy Kern: Yes, she did try

122
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.530
Cindy Kern: Yes, that's

123
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.510
TJ McKenna: My mind it's Cathy triathlons

124
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.880
Cindy Kern: Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right. So,

125
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.020
Margaret Foster: Cindy, are you still there.

126
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.340
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

127
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.450
TJ McKenna: Let's give it a second. So either come back or drop out.

128
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.500
Yeah.

129
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.750
Margaret Foster: I like the details. Remember about people cap new does triathlons

130
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.140
TJ McKenna: That's how you. That's how you do it. So you remember names.

131
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.040
Yeah.

132
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.320
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

133
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:03.930
TJ McKenna: We do with my pre service crew when there's a huge group. We found one of the better things to do is to do

134
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:15.210
TJ McKenna: You know, everybody does, you know, say your name and say something fun. You're doing this summer, say, and like people come up with the most random stuff and it's sometimes hard like I'm gonna go to the beach.

135
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:29.460
TJ McKenna: Like, that doesn't stick. And so we started doing. They say your name, you know, whatever program you're in elementary ed or whatever special ed and then something super, super boring about you.

136
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.750
TJ McKenna: And they're so good. They're so good I

137
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.330
TJ McKenna: Just like you almost get a little glimpse into somebody's personality like somebody will say, like, and I'm I'm five foot one

138
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:56.430
TJ McKenna: Or somebody will say like my eye color is gray or I really, really like having three pillows on my bed.

139
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.380
TJ McKenna: And they like. They like is that little glimpse into like what

140
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.820
TJ McKenna: What you know something about you but also what you think is boring about you.

141
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.230
TJ McKenna: And a lot of times

142
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.190
TJ McKenna: As you go around people generally don't want to say the same thing.

143
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.430
TJ McKenna: And so they start saying stuff that's like really, really good.

144
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.660
TJ McKenna: Like, that's not boring and they say another thing that's not boring either like more and you're out one more hallway.

145
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.810
TJ McKenna: becomes just a really fun conversation of, like, is this boring about me like

146
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.810
Margaret Foster: That's a good icebreaker yeah

147
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:40.470
Margaret Foster: Cuz sometimes it's harder to come up with things that are exciting you know depending on what kind of lifestyle, especially if you're like a student or about to be a teacher.

148
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.750
Margaret Foster: Yes, like I do my homework like

149
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.170
Margaret Foster: To say

150
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.620
TJ McKenna: That it's like i think it's it's a good icebreaker and almost like a secret culture building

151
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.080
TJ McKenna: Because you can see who laughs at what

152
00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:03.270
TJ McKenna: And who knows each other and you know if they, you know, I always try to go somewhere in the mix. So it's not like me going first or be going last

153
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.290
Margaret Foster: Hmm.

154
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.040
That's good.

155
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.170
TJ McKenna: It is pretty ridiculous.

156
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.170
Margaret Foster: All these great tips. I'm get a file that boy for the next seven have to read it. Nice.

157
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.680
Margaret Foster: That's good. That's really good.

158
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.560
Margaret Foster: Should I, you know, Cindy. Again, Jason, what is

159
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.330
TJ McKenna: The link if she got into it.

160
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.290
Yeah.

161
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:26.970
TJ McKenna: Yeah.

162
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.110
TJ McKenna: Just wonder of her internet. It's funny, I think she is

163
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.160
TJ McKenna: I can't remember what she's out in the woods. Yeah. I wonder if he's got trickier internet

164
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.860
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

165
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:46.590
TJ McKenna: And you have this on just with both are now the password wasn't even I didn't ask me for the password.

166
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.670
Margaret Foster: I think if you click the like personalized link.

167
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.610
Margaret Foster: It'll last for a password. Maybe or maybe

168
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.220
Margaret Foster: I'm doing it doesn't ask for a password or something.

169
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:05.580
TJ McKenna: I just know with mine. I set the set the waiting room up so that if we're people try to join that I don't recognize I just kick them out.

170
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.560
TJ McKenna: Yeah, but

171
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.260
Margaret Foster: Twice haven't gotten there yet.

172
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.290
Margaret Foster: Um,

173
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:22.890
Margaret Foster: I might have lost track of what Cindy was thinking about at the end because I think it was a question that or a follow up question you asked, do you remember what it was.

174
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:33.900
TJ McKenna: Yeah, she was just checking. I know that I remember her being at UNH before Cindy just text me. I'm trying to get back in. So let me send her the link

175
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:45.210
TJ McKenna: She was at UNH at the time. And then I don't know if the

176
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:54.000
TJ McKenna: And this is probably isn't helpful for what we need. I just sent her the zoom links should jump back in

177
00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:03.120
TJ McKenna: That somewhere in the nutrient project. She got this better gig at Quinnipiac to like be the director of the project.

178
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.090
TJ McKenna: That's we don't really need to follow up on that.

179
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:17.100
TJ McKenna: I think we can spend the majority of the time just unpacking the new train experience like the first couple days. What do you would you would you think

180
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.720
TJ McKenna: I can leave that question once she jumps back in

181
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:32.010
Margaret Foster: My transition was going to be, you know, so how did it light up with your expectations GJ obviously nobody calling you out for adopting elementary school teacher, though, that worked well for you.

182
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.140
TJ McKenna: I wonder if we have the

183
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.060
TJ McKenna: Same here.

184
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.390
TJ McKenna: It's just cleaning stuff and found it.

185
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.810
TJ McKenna: somebody's name badges.

186
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.090
TJ McKenna: And way too many phones like I feel like I hide my privilege in this drawer.

187
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.290
TJ McKenna: Had that phone. And this phone. And this one.

188
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:20.910
Margaret Foster: I wish that there were an easier way to go about, like, I don't know. I also I have old computers which at this point.

189
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.890
TJ McKenna: Or opposed to I'm here.

190
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:29.190
Margaret Foster: Yeah, like at this point, I am not even sure that I could get them to turn on to get all the files off of them.

191
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:29.970
Well,

192
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.500
Margaret Foster: Yeah. What am I going to do now, they just kind of collecting dust somewhere.

193
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:40.530
TJ McKenna: Yeah, and like random tablets, like everyone tries to my teacher likes computer stuff. Let's give him this

194
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.460
TJ McKenna: And so I have like

195
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.020
TJ McKenna: Two candles likes you know an old iPad that barely works.

196
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:52.560
TJ McKenna: It's like I wish there was a way to, you know, they're full of rare earth metals, be nice to

197
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.250
TJ McKenna: Screen off for us the screen or something.

198
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:04.620
Margaret Foster: Yeah yeah yeah I think about that all the time like lack of sustainability and, like, how do you recycle stuff. I don't know.

199
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.210
TJ McKenna: I wish I did.

200
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.930
TJ McKenna: Was I just reading about I went down a climate change rabbit hole and the

201
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:18.900
TJ McKenna: That how I think it was China bought this area in Mexico that had all these rare earth.

202
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:37.110
TJ McKenna: Materials and Mexico didn't know about it at all. Didn't care at all. And so, China, like came in and was like harvesting all this, I forget what it was, but something that you need to make cell phones and the cartel found out that, like, what are these Chinese people doing here.

203
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:49.350
TJ McKenna: And I bet they're getting something that we could get. And so they like started murdering people and took it over and then didn't know what to do, like, sorry. Now, how do we get the stuff out of it.

204
00:19:51.180 --> 00:20:02.670
TJ McKenna: Was like this whole messy, like I felt like I was reading this art know very well that you'd love it if I could find it the way that they like were able to unpack this story and tell the story.

205
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.630
TJ McKenna: But

206
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.570
TJ McKenna: I felt like I was reading this journal article or, you know, online article that was like a movie like

207
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.850
TJ McKenna: Rich and like the turns and the well written.

208
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:21.690
Margaret Foster: Yeah, sometimes I forget that we really only unique real life you know it is as good as fiction.

209
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.890
TJ McKenna: Yes.

210
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.790
Margaret Foster: That's crazy. Was this recent or was it several years ago, I think.

211
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.290
TJ McKenna: It was within like the last

212
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.340
Five years

213
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.040
TJ McKenna: And

214
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:39.420
TJ McKenna: How I got on and we're doing the climate pathway with the big low folks. And I'm assuming it's that

215
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.300
TJ McKenna: She just said my Wi Fi is dead in my service service and my phone is body resetting my router.

216
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.790
TJ McKenna: Always happens when you're in the middle of something

217
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.490
Margaret Foster: Yeah, so it's likely Sunday we

218
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.130
Margaret Foster: I ended up there was a comedy of errors. So it took like

219
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:12.750
Margaret Foster: Yeah, like half an hour. Just, just get the Wi Fi and everything working and we ended up like the sound wasn't working. So I just called her and put it on speakerphone see each other. And yeah, it was a mess.

220
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:19.020
TJ McKenna: I didn't look at the time, or we heard she texted me so I should have that time.

221
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.870
TJ McKenna: So 1015

222
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.130
TJ McKenna: And then whenever she comes back on. We'll just mark for

223
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.140
TJ McKenna: Me not to transcribe

224
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.130
Margaret Foster: Right, yeah.
