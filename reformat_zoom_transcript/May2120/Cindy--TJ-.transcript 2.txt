00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.080
Margaret Foster: Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah. And are you drinking iced tea.

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
Cindy Kern: I'm actually just drinking water down iced coffee.

3
00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.430
Margaret Foster: Ah, yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.930
Margaret Foster: I saying

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:32.880
Cindy Kern: Yeah, I had a couple hot coffee this morning, my 830 meaning I switched over to iced coffee and I didn't refresh. Before I came in here. I just hopped out of one to another. So

6
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.380
Margaret Foster: Running on coffee. Yep. Same

7
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.950
Cindy Kern: It's not much different than my entire life.

8
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.230
Margaret Foster: No, I'm saying I i've been amazed, like, wow, I'm probably just as busy is not just okay

9
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.010
Right.

10
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.810
Cindy Kern: Yeah, it's kind of insane. It's kind of insane. I actually, yeah, kind of insane but

11
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.800
Cindy Kern: I guess new normals finding new normals.

12
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.050
Cindy Kern: Yeah, yeah. Yep.

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.540
Margaret Foster: Yeah, one

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.490
Cindy Kern: Is TJ doing this or is it just us.

15
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.260
Margaret Foster: To my knowledge, but I also want to be mindful of your time and I know it's only half an hour. This time, so we can go ahead and get started.

16
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.900
Cindy Kern: And then whatever I'm waiting for TJ.

17
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.660
Cindy Kern: And my next meeting this and until I think 11

18
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.850
Margaret Foster: So, yeah.

19
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.820
Cindy Kern: Yeah, I think I don't know what my next meeting is

20
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.470
Cindy Kern: Yes 11

21
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.160
So,

22
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.760
Margaret Foster: Yeah, listen, she's not here, but like 1005 and I think we can

23
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.510
Cindy Kern: Go for it. Sure. What's your

24
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.560
Cindy Kern: What's your number one advice for

25
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.970
Cindy Kern: Surviving TJ but Canada for surviving

26
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.640
Cindy Kern: Isolation

27
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.530
Margaret Foster: Oh,

28
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.230
Margaret Foster: going outside.

29
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.960
Cindy Kern: I think. Yeah. Beautiful right now.

30
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.790
Margaret Foster: Yeah yeah and

31
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.940
Margaret Foster: Like underrated. I don't know. I have a friend in Spain, and they're not allowed to leave their house and he's just kind of like, oh,

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.540
Margaret Foster: Yeah, because, you know, it's so good. Like, you can still remember go out and stuff so

33
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.930
Cindy Kern: I think definitely minus our garden.

34
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:32.310
Cindy Kern: We have we neglected it for a good three years. Our son was a was a sport varsity athlete which from sophomore year, on which meant that he

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:52.650
Cindy Kern: We didn't have a weekend ever. And so we totally neglected. Our, our garden for three years. And so the garden and building the chicken coop for baby chickens that we picked up the week, the week that this all started

36
00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:07.950
Cindy Kern: That that has been the that has been the secret to surviving isolation have been those two things. So we're going to plant on Thursday. So, but we have. I don't know if you miss this way, every table in our house. Can I, can we see this

37
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.890
Cindy Kern: See all this

38
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.590
Cindy Kern: Yeah, every, every person pretty much every flat surface in our house that has any kind of natural light associated with it.

39
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.470
Cindy Kern: Has baby plants.

40
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.940
Cindy Kern: growing on it. So yeah, yeah. But on the ground on Thursday.

41
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.460
TJ McKenna: July licks my lilacs are out of control. They've exploded. They're my favorite

42
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.600
TJ McKenna: And so they're

43
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:47.430
TJ McKenna: They're all blooming right now. And so I just step on my deck cut a couple, but I'm in the pot. Bring them inside and like I literally opened the door for my bedroom. This morning, and it was lilacs.

44
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.350
Cindy Kern: Oh, that's awesome.

45
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.860
So,

46
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.120
Margaret Foster: We

47
00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:03.240
Cindy Kern: Have to talk to separately TJ, because we have to lilac tree bushes things that we inherited with the house and we never had lilacs before and

48
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:17.130
Cindy Kern: We get huge purple blossoms on one huge white blossoms on the other and but they look so damn on happy so like the flowers look awesome. But we'll have to talk about how to

49
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.780
Cindy Kern: make them happier.

50
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.700
TJ McKenna: The trick is you have to be really mean to them.

51
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:33.240
TJ McKenna: Okay, they bloom better if you're mean to them. If you don't like mulch around them. You gotta like hack them back and not even like, you know, nice pruning and cut this in cut that like they like

52
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.450
TJ McKenna: Parts broken off to like shape them because they get unruly. They look kind of woodsy very fast.

53
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.100
Cindy Kern: And so yeah, exactly.

54
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.810
TJ McKenna: Yeah, you have to be mean to them and they are like there there are wildly bunch. They're like, No, I'm coming back. I'm coming back.

55
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.710
Cindy Kern: Then I

56
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.870
TJ McKenna: Want to go that way. I

57
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.030
Cindy Kern: Really respect Lee likes even more now.

58
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.540
Cindy Kern: Just with up not

59
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.090
TJ McKenna: Bad ass like you smell this.

60
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.550
TJ McKenna: Smell this flower. That's because you broke my arm off.

61
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.100
Cindy Kern: Yeah, I come back in a smell bad.

62
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.890
TJ McKenna: Yes, in your face.

63
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.270
You want allergies.

64
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.230
Cindy Kern: Calling right up your nose.

65
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.580
Cindy Kern: Um, yeah.

66
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:45.060
Margaret Foster: So maybe nobody in your terrain lilacs as the thing that they want to read a curriculum, about which is unfortunate because it's called New terrain. So you would think.

67
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.100
TJ McKenna: perfect segue. Yeah, perfect segue.

68
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.390
Margaret Foster: Yeah, killing it. Yeah.

69
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.200
Cindy Kern: I'm impressed.

70
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm impressed.

71
00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:04.290
Margaret Foster: So, oh, better either better. Okay, next time you can read a curriculum about how the lilacs grow back faster as part of your next professional development experience. But for now.

72
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:17.580
Margaret Foster: No going back to I think roadkill was, um, but, so the last time we kind of talked a little bit about what brought you reach your projects, saying, I'm sorry, what brought you to new terrain.

73
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:29.220
Margaret Foster: And then, but I think our biggest question this time is like what. What did you take from new terrain. So for Cindy and in Project saying what are the parts that

74
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:43.950
Margaret Foster: What are the things from new terrain that you chuck that informed your experience there or were the things that you decided to not take that as kind of a critique or building on what you learned from new terrain and GJ it's

75
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.270
TJ McKenna: Yeah, I think that's like there's in my mind. There's two chunks to that like

76
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:59.700
TJ McKenna: You remember the first couple days where it was Mark when shuttle and Brian facilitating and then Susan Wilson gave a talk.

77
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:11.370
TJ McKenna: And then gene was there and Sarah was there and there was like I don't know 6070 of us all in the room. Like, what was your, what was your take on the kickoff the new terrain, because you were saying last time.

78
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:25.200
TJ McKenna: You know you're new to the area you were just like, I guess I'll be involved like that, that those first couple days to me. I think we're eye opening. And so I wonder your take, remembering back to the beginning.

79
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.730
Cindy Kern: To be honest with you. It was very similar to some of the things that we had done in Las Vegas.

80
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:45.180
Cindy Kern: Las Vegas is the fourth largest school district in the nation. So we're talking 350,000 students 200,000 teachers.

81
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:54.600
Cindy Kern: Maybe a maybe 150,000 teachers. And so when we did mass PDs a room of

82
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:05.310
Cindy Kern: You know 70 8100 teachers was not per se. It wasn't the norm, but it wasn't per se abstract idea for us.

83
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.000
Cindy Kern: That that actually that that construct

84
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.060
Cindy Kern: Made me feel

85
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.920
Cindy Kern: Like I was

86
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:31.470
Cindy Kern: Kind of made me feel like I was at home again to have a lot of people in the room, and a lot of what we would refer to as in our professional development work back in Vegas. You know, we have

87
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:51.330
Cindy Kern: We all of us as a team had our parts in our places. And I was, it was easy for me to see that as a team, who was responsible for what and what they were doing. So it actually fit a professional development model that I understood and I lived for about 15 years

88
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:58.950
Cindy Kern: So I think that from the structure, the PD. There was comforting.

89
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:12.750
Cindy Kern: I, I am a kind of an asshole. And the idea that I'm constantly in those situations, thinking about how it could be better instead of living in the moment of

90
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:24.840
Cindy Kern: What I'm learning from the people I'm thinking about how to improve the professional development. It's happening. So I always live in that space. So I think from day one through day done

91
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:41.610
Cindy Kern: My goal was, how, how do I take this tweak this improve this nothing. It was bad, like, Please don't think that those words mean it's bad, it's just the recursive, it just a recursive design cycle.

92
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.430
Cindy Kern: How do I, how do I do this in the future. And can I make it better.

93
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.930
Cindy Kern: Is always part of my brain. So

94
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.470
Cindy Kern: I don't know if I answered your question though we're not TJ.

95
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.830
TJ McKenna: But I think the

96
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:08.700
TJ McKenna: One of the things that I definitely walked away with was, you know, and I was new to the PD world. And so I was coming from the far other side of the room.

97
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:19.140
TJ McKenna: But I knew my science and I, or at least I thought I did. And I remember driving home one day after like the air puppies and the, you know,

98
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:28.740
TJ McKenna: Eric science doesn't suck kind of stuff thinking like, wait, wearing not entirely understand the content and and I

99
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:38.100
TJ McKenna: I was still, I think I know aced everything I took every science test I, you know, was seen as the science guy.

100
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:55.020
TJ McKenna: And still was like I am not sure that I like it kind of rattled my foundation and I found I felt that in the beginning. And I think that's what made me almost double down and get more excited about. It was like there's something here. Like, and I remember the same thing like

101
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.190
TJ McKenna: Seeing things for the Michael I don't know that I would do it that way. But I also don't know much about the PD world.

102
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:11.610
TJ McKenna: But I think I was re energized by the energy in the room, certain people that I met and kind of this focus to

103
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:21.810
TJ McKenna: Almost the focus of like seeing the leadership, the people that were running stuff like trying to be reactive in the moment of like, I don't

104
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:31.500
TJ McKenna: I don't think that went so well maybe we should do it this way, and like trying to be reactive to the group. And I don't know if you picked up on that as well. Or if that was just because I was new.

105
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:43.260
Cindy Kern: It's interesting because I'm one of the metrics that we use since like 2008 with the and I'm sorry I'm bringing up Las Vegas so much but it's my it's my

106
00:11:44.400 --> 00:12:01.920
Cindy Kern: Analog for the neutering. One of the things that we did from 2008 was we always chose topics that all of us were uncomfortable with to dive in and to develop our professional like to do our professional developments around our to week to week

107
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.400
Cindy Kern: Summer Institute's and then our year long, a synchronous

108
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.600
Cindy Kern: Class work that was associated with it. So,

109
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:22.980
Cindy Kern: Like I said, like this model you even think about the online delivery of it was new to me. But the overall model was something that

110
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.030
Cindy Kern: Was not new to me at all. So the

111
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:38.010
Cindy Kern: We always wanted to be in that exact space because if we were in that space that you're discussing TJ, we had the opportunity to a understand the learner.

112
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:54.030
Cindy Kern: And be understand how since making and conceptual change, which was the model that we worked from and hence, of course we evolve over years, as we understand teaching, learning better but we understand those constructs, so

113
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:06.060
Cindy Kern: I was energized by the idea that I was questioning myself and that something that it was appear to be so some bold was something that I could dive into and feel that sense of

114
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:25.920
Cindy Kern: I'm, I'm excited to engage with us because I understand. I understand that this is going to end up being fun and my frustrations and my my lack of knowledge because I'm self regulated, because I have that drive is going to push me to understand that so much more

115
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:37.860
Cindy Kern: There was one aspect of the design that I kept coming back to, and it's something that I've run into project saying was the concept in the construct of self regulation and self regulated learning learners.

116
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:50.310
Cindy Kern: Because we anybody sitting in that room are self regulated, they are suffering learners, otherwise they wouldn't have made it that far. So how do we support students in this process.

117
00:13:50.850 --> 00:14:02.280
Cindy Kern: Through the development of their self regulation. Their, their efficacy. Their, their motivation, so on and so forth. So like that was a that was something I picked up on.

118
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.680
Cindy Kern: Probably within the first couple days there was, okay, we're adult learners. We all have master's degrees or higher. This is stuff that we're interested in. Now, what are some of the

119
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:26.760
Cindy Kern: pitfalls that we're going to come across with our kids. And how do we accentuate those things, or how do we scaffold those aspects to make sure that we have the kids engaged, which when you watch the videos from new terrain.

120
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:37.230
Cindy Kern: Those aspects are in there, right, like when you see it and you see the teachers engaging with it and engaging with their students. They exist, but they're not made explicit

121
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:52.200
Cindy Kern: So that's like, that was something I pulled out right away when I thought about when I was designing project saying that that would be a constant undercurrent for the teachers as they engaged with

122
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:59.070
Cindy Kern: With NGOs x, it would be the part of the flavor of project saying

123
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.370
Cindy Kern: And I picked it up because I watched it and I experienced it. And I engaged with IT IN NEW TRAIN

124
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.910
Cindy Kern: Am I talking too much about Project sing or like the

125
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.050
Cindy Kern: Service.

126
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:26.970
TJ McKenna: And I think the like that self regulation led me right to thinking about the hubs and I was in the eastern hub. I don't know which HUB YOU WERE INVOLVED IN when we remember when we broke up from new terrain and we went into like those

127
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.540
TJ McKenna: Mel facilitated the cell facilitated groups and

128
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.090
TJ McKenna: Puppies. Yeah, it was a ghost.

129
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.980
Cindy Kern: Like I had my own because I had people from all over the state.

130
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.350
Cindy Kern: Because I had somebody else find people for me.

131
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:48.750
TJ McKenna: But how did that. How did your hub experience go when you were like, okay, now you're going to facilitate day four, and you're going to do day five.

132
00:15:51.690 --> 00:16:08.160
TJ McKenna: And it might. I mean, it was very long ago but like kind of the takeaway from like this what you were talking about in Vegas. This model of like we all come together, we all work together in this in this big social group and now okay go learn it on your own.

133
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.600
Um,

134
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:17.610
Cindy Kern: Yeah, it was, it was that was an interesting, that was an interesting aspect and i think i think part of the

135
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.380
Cindy Kern: The group that I worked with, I think part of what

136
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:35.730
Cindy Kern: This kind of makes me sound like an asshole. And I don't mean to sound like an asshole. But I think part of the reason it worked was that there was an individual there who had

137
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.980
Cindy Kern: The

138
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:52.980
Cindy Kern: experience and knowledge of the teaching and learning aspects are learning and teaching aspects that were being put forward to keep them on a road that led to what the actual in game was does that

139
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.000
Cindy Kern: Make sense like

140
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:54.720
TJ McKenna: I'm guessing that

141
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.540
Cindy Kern: At the time it was nice. Yeah.

142
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.380
TJ McKenna: Were there.

143
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:09.870
TJ McKenna: When I was there anybody else like another higher ed person in your hub. No, no. Yeah. And that was like mine Eastern was, I think we had

144
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:26.760
TJ McKenna: Three it folks and then maybe two or three that were not. And so there was like a power dynamics that was very interesting in our hub and I just never heard about a different how a win or as I

145
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.800
Cindy Kern: Know we had, I had three and 14

146
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.480
Cindy Kern: I had for teachers and myself.

147
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.200
Cindy Kern: And when they would facilitate

148
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.580
Cindy Kern: When they would facilitate the discussion or they facilitate what was going on.

149
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:52.110
Cindy Kern: I mean, just like any of us do. It's not like I took over and said, but why it was like okay so let's steer in this direction because

150
00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:08.040
Cindy Kern: I mean my entire doctoral work was based on Brian's like not based but I read all of Brian's work. I knew where he was coming from. I read all of, like, I read a ton of G moon stuff I read a ton of, like, it's not like I i was coming in.

151
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:16.410
Cindy Kern: Not knowing what their endgame was because I had experienced it through my doctoral program right so

152
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:32.970
Cindy Kern: Like I was able to do that. And that was it was done with them left and leadership role and just with good moves, good stuff that we all talk about but

153
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:47.100
Cindy Kern: I worried with an i apologize. Come back to project sing. But one of the design issues that I had was, when you have a group of five teachers that are doing these things by themselves sitting in their, in their schools.

154
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.050
Cindy Kern: How much does it turn into a bitch session.

155
00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:05.490
Cindy Kern: excuse my language. But how often is it turned to a bitch session or how long, how often does it lead to stew teachers using the context of NGOs to draw the conclusions they already have

156
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:25.470
Cindy Kern: And how to mitigate that I would be interested to see and hear how NGS X actually kind of worked through that and how they facilitated THAT BECAUSE WE WE KNOW I LOVE teachers, but we know that

157
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.390
Cindy Kern: We do that right. We're going to see how the evidence fits our belief system and

158
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:40.710
Cindy Kern: So, and we do have our own belief systems about how to teach and learn. So, um,

159
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.740
Cindy Kern: Yeah, so that's

160
00:19:45.390 --> 00:20:05.370
TJ McKenna: What I remembered like skipping forward to that. I think it's, I don't know if it's a new terrain part two, or whatever. But like when we started building the curriculum materials. I remember Team Awesome. We once we formed we the I remember you saying to and I cannot remember

161
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.100
TJ McKenna: My claims of the teachers. Oh.

162
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.160
TJ McKenna: Are our two Roadkill

163
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.590
Cindy Kern: Why can't remember their names.

164
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.270
TJ McKenna: I'm spacing on it, but the

165
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:26.010
TJ McKenna: The one that was like holding her textbook so tight. And I remember you like buying it from her hands and saying, I'm just going to put it under your chair.

166
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:34.440
TJ McKenna: You can have it. You can have it whenever you need it, but I'm going to put it under your chair because like for her. That was everything. And it was like, well, let's just

167
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:41.340
TJ McKenna: Open it up and and you know we started with a blank piece of paper and I know a lot of groups kind of went in different directions, but we

168
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.830
TJ McKenna: I remember that vividly remember the conversation of, like, well you asking them, what do you want to teach

169
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:56.670
TJ McKenna: And they said, you know, matter, energy and matter of fruit ecosystems. We're like, All right, well what's problematic about that and you know they very much wanted to do the

170
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:08.550
TJ McKenna: You know the bunnies eat the grass, the hockey. The bunnies and like there's some sunshine. Like, that's an ecosystem. We were like, I'm not exactly like we're missing some elements and you

171
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.440
TJ McKenna: Know, listen, Jay.

172
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.310
Jay,

173
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:28.020
TJ McKenna: And I, and so I remember, like, I think that whole first day we just like opened it up for dialogue and discourse and thinking about, like, like what's what's messed up with that and I think I even have a picture of our, you know, our first

174
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:29.700
TJ McKenna: Paper.

175
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.600
Cindy Kern: Where we were

176
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.310
TJ McKenna: You know we we ended up with like, well, we need to like pause this, because this is so fluid.

177
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:42.540
TJ McKenna: And like we need something that can represent the entire ecosystem. And that was how we were like when you know when roadkill and something gets hit

178
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:50.850
TJ McKenna: It's like a timeout and like we can think about where that came from and where that when and and we've we've had a lot of discussions.

179
00:21:51.630 --> 00:22:05.070
TJ McKenna: Maggie and Jean and I about like, why did that, like, how did we go in that direction. And, you know, hash it out and it wasn't easy. We we hit lots of walls, but other groups kind of floundered

180
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:21.450
Cindy Kern: I think part of that is like and kind of kind of sound like an asshole. Again, but I'm like, I think about at that point I had been teaching curriculum design for 10 years right and

181
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:45.810
Cindy Kern: I've, I've managed a lot of personalities in that in those scenarios. Right. I was so incredibly grateful for having a content expert in there, not that I'm I don't think I can do a middle school ecosystems, but

182
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.630
Cindy Kern: The the

183
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:56.130
Cindy Kern: Like having like first of all we had. We had individuals who are willing to give it a go.

184
00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:06.210
Cindy Kern: Right. Second of all, we worked on unpacking where their knowledge was at and where they felt their strengths were at. And then we were able to question especially

185
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:17.220
Cindy Kern: When you as a content expert and myself having content knowledge, we were able to question and ask the same type of questions and probing questions that we would ask kids like

186
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:28.980
Cindy Kern: What's happening here. Why is it happening like not just not just it happens. But how and the why. So we literally took them through

187
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:41.880
Cindy Kern: In an in a design and a unit design. We took them through what they would have to know in order to say they they did it. We did a causal explanation prior to

188
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:51.840
Cindy Kern: Getting too far into all we're going to do this collectivity, we're going to do this collectivity, which is great for some teachers, but if you don't know why you're doing it then.

189
00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:00.780
Cindy Kern: You put it in there and then you try to backwards design it. Well, let's think about what we really want to know. And really what the kids have to understand

190
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.730
Cindy Kern: And then let's think of all the different resources that we have and that we've used in that are awesome.

191
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:12.150
Cindy Kern: And let's take the ones out that don't apply to exactly what they need to know and then let's think about where they go in there.

192
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:19.650
Cindy Kern: And that's kind of how we did it. And when we didn't have when we had something that didn't have an activity, then we said, what could we do

193
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:38.100
Cindy Kern: Well um you drew on this. I do understand I think about the loss of heat like energy. Energy transfer and the very idea of the the thermometer in I don't even know if it's in the new one. But we had talked about the thermometer in the mitten.

194
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.760
Cindy Kern: And it's a monitor in the hand with them and then the difference between those

195
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:48.000
Cindy Kern: But like, because we knew that this was an important thing where we don't just say energy is lost to the system.

196
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.960
Cindy Kern: But we have

197
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:55.290
Cindy Kern: Students collect evidence about it. We said, nope. We need a concrete experience where students get the opportunity to see

198
00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:08.340
Cindy Kern: To actually make sense of something that is a theory. Oh, when we say energy is lost to the system. So I think that we spent time with their prior knowledge. I think we spent time probing and

199
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.040
Cindy Kern: Poking and teasing out

200
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:24.570
Cindy Kern: Ideas that they were, they didn't spend time thinking about the How're the why, how the observable cousins. The observable.

201
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:40.830
Cindy Kern: And once they had a picture of it. They are they are amazing educators. So once they saw the whole picture and what the end game look like even though we didn't all have a really good

202
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:58.590
Cindy Kern: grasp of what the standard was asking us, because it was meant to be a sixth grade and that being a fifth grade, I think that in the long run. They understood how to what has to happen in order to develop something over time is. I think that's what I think happened.

203
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.330
Cindy Kern: Hmm. There's a lot of talking, you say, TJ. I feel like you're interviewing me. TJ.

204
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.370
Cindy Kern: And this is this supposed to be like a group fucking thing.

205
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.450
Cindy Kern: What are you doing here.

206
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:16.770
TJ McKenna: I mean, I remember it in a very similar way. And I think that like the managing personalities thing was kind of part of it because I remember

207
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:26.760
TJ McKenna: Driving. You know, I think it was like a, you know, hour and a half for me, which is a long time and a jeep. That was lifted and had some wobble issues.

208
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:38.070
TJ McKenna: My previous Jeep new Jeep fine old GI problems and but I like was so excited to get there. And I remember so many weekends, we get there. And they'd be like, Okay, go.

209
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:47.070
TJ McKenna: Do it. We're like, what, and like I remember so many groups being like, what are we supposed to. How do we start. Where are we and

210
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:56.310
TJ McKenna: I remember we were like Team Awesome Game on. Let's do it. Where are we, you know, and we would just get after it and like you know we weren't, we weren't working in a linear fashion.

211
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:06.150
TJ McKenna: But we were always working on something and I remember we would get kind of stalled at the table as we move to the window and we go to the window and we start working in the window.

212
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.380
Cindy Kern: No quick

213
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.010
Yep.

214
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.500
Cindy Kern: Oh shit, okay.

215
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.800
Cindy Kern: I can sound like my house was falling apart.

216
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:22.800
Cindy Kern: And the, the laundry room is right below me and it was off set pals on spin cycle.

217
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.750
TJ McKenna: I was like, Oh my God, my

218
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.000
Cindy Kern: House is falling down. Okay, sorry.

219
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.770
TJ McKenna: It's a whole different phenomenon right there.

220
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.510
TJ McKenna: Yeah, you gotta balance hotels, just like a good equation I'm

221
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.920
Cindy Kern: Sorry, back to back to

222
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:41.760
TJ McKenna: So we were moving around and you know in different places, just to make sure we were always making progress. And I think sometimes we were getting stuck.

223
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:57.300
TJ McKenna: And so I think, you know, looking at the time, like. So based on this entire insane process starting from the massive group going into these hubs then moving into the small group curriculum work over the sustained time like were there.

224
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:15.600
TJ McKenna: One or two key elements that you felt like were necessary for Project sing. Have you already thought through project, saying, or like kind of where what was the genesis of that project. And then what did you choose were nuggets that you were like this has got to be in there but not that

225
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.480
Margaret Foster: Also, I just, I'm okay to stay on a little bit past 1030 and I think Cindy said she was

226
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:27.810
Margaret Foster: So I'm not sure about your schedule as well. Teach. So we're going to put that out there.

227
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:33.600
Cindy Kern: Or yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Till 11 and I don't want to go to the 11 o'clock meeting so I'm

228
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:48.720
TJ McKenna: About 11 o'clock. But then somebody else or just asked me to spend 15 minutes on a on a survey pre that so that we could send it out on a different paper like how to school just ended, and now I'm busier. How did that happen. Yeah, yeah.

229
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.400
Cindy Kern: Summer School started this week.

230
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.410
Cindy Kern: And I have three classes the session.

231
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.450
TJ McKenna: Doing three during summer session.

232
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.280
TJ McKenna: Ended

233
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.830
Cindy Kern: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

234
00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.700
TJ McKenna: Oh,

235
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.040
Cindy Kern: Yeah, it's gonna it's gonna be a

236
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.630
Cindy Kern: Co.

237
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.030
Cindy Kern: Pastor so

238
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.120
Cindy Kern: The

239
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.310
Cindy Kern: question you asked related back to project sing.

240
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.400
Cindy Kern: But I actually don't know what you asked me.

241
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:28.380
TJ McKenna: Just basically like the new terrain was literally new terrain. For me it was like such a, like a different thing that there was like this massive launch that was kind of all over the place.

242
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:36.720
TJ McKenna: And then like a refining down into these hubs that also, like, remember we came back and we did our share out some, like, wow. Everybody had drastically different experiences.

243
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:44.880
TJ McKenna: And then we were all kind of locked in a room to build curriculum and still within that everybody had drastically different experiences. And so I wonder at

244
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:58.200
TJ McKenna: WHAT POINT DID YOU DID project saying come to you and I'm sure it's over, you know, iterations of thinking about it, but like what elements from new train where you're like, that's that part. I gotta do, but that stuff. I'm not doing

245
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.470
Cindy Kern: Keep sound like an asshole.

246
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.450
TJ McKenna: You will not

247
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.190
Cindy Kern: You promise TJ.

248
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.320
Cindy Kern: Maybe doesn't know me as well as you know me.

249
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.930
Cindy Kern: Making my think she's an asshole.

250
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.610
TJ McKenna: The whole point of this

251
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:18.780
TJ McKenna: Is, you know, we're we're writing up the case and the case need like can't be an ad for NGOs acts.

252
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:35.610
TJ McKenna: Like we want other states to see this is how messy. It was to try to scale this because, you know, we're also going into the work at the Science Center, and there were major fatal flaws in that work too. And so we're just trying to paint the whole picture.

253
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.290
Cindy Kern: Okay, so

254
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:49.050
TJ McKenna: And when in a direction that was positive. And so, you know, how did you do that, how did you negotiate the elements that you felt like weren't successful and the elements that you felt like were wasted time

255
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.130
Cindy Kern: Okay, so the

256
00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:02.340
Cindy Kern: The structure that I kept about 85% intact was NGS x

257
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.740
Cindy Kern: The facilitation of it over the course of

258
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.640
Cindy Kern: A year, twice, so I had to one year cycles was

259
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.090
Cindy Kern: Very different.

260
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:43.560
Cindy Kern: We didn't get to curriculum design until second year, we spent a longer period of time on on NGOs sucks targeting and then we did NGOs at but I it's my time was also spent with them on, like I said,

261
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.960
Cindy Kern: engaging students and self regulated learners through the process.

262
00:31:50.490 --> 00:32:02.130
Cindy Kern: Really developing and thinking more succinctly about how the strategies that were demonstrated in GFX actually take time and

263
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:12.600
Cindy Kern: Time and training, I'll say teaching to how to how to do the strategies that are in NGS x. And so we unpack

264
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.470
Each of those

265
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:20.430
Cindy Kern: The frustration for a teacher who doesn't understand how to do something and they see an exemplar

266
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:31.200
Cindy Kern: That has June 10 have a great summer on the video behind them and the students do it perfectly, and they're trying to do it in September and they don't understand well they're not

267
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:42.120
Cindy Kern: Why their students are doing this and then having to work through teacher efficacy in understanding locus of control and where it lies throughout the throughout the school year.

268
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:51.510
Cindy Kern: Where it's heavily, heavily teacher scaffold it and how the scaffolds are removed throughout the year, so the kids can engage that way into year

269
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.840
Cindy Kern: Spending time

270
00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:06.150
Cindy Kern: Not just thinking about why these things are important and what they look like, but how you get kids to those steps was a lot of projects thing.

271
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.890
Cindy Kern: So we would meet to do

272
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:16.290
Cindy Kern: The modules which we only did I think one module individually.

273
00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:29.520
Cindy Kern: I can't remember which one it was. But we only did one module individually. So they did it at their hub. I felt comfortable with what they had to do with it. I felt like there wasn't a lot of latitude.

274
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:46.290
Cindy Kern: And so we did that one individually, and we did all the other ones I facilitated with them throughout the year. And then we had additional days where we did nothing with NGOs X and all we did was, think about scaffolding student engagement.

275
00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:53.010
Cindy Kern: From early skill development through, I can do this sap.

276
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.970
Cindy Kern: Excuse me I'm turning away from you guys like it's any less loud or any less as I coughed. That was funny.

277
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.590
Cindy Kern: Anyways, um,

278
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.790
Cindy Kern: So we spent a lot of time.

279
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:23.670
Cindy Kern: With all like every single meeting every single thing that we did had a self regulate self regulation aspect to it are deep dives into strategies and looks of strategies over time and scaffold strategies over time.

280
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:32.850
Cindy Kern: Those, those were the major changes for Project sing your one project seeing your to

281
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:41.880
Cindy Kern: The second the for the people who are in projects in one they took the year and we we scaffold did

282
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:55.110
Cindy Kern: curriculum development and I will tell you that I wasn't happy with the curriculum development. I wasn't as happy with my my

283
00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:13.800
Cindy Kern: I didn't get the products I wanted to get and part of it was I had 20 people and I had one of me and it if there wasn't enough of the pushing and the teasing and that would happen with a larger group of people engaging in that. Don't get me wrong for

284
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.410
Cindy Kern: They've been engaging with in GFS for a year.

285
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.880
Cindy Kern: They were buying far

286
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:38.970
Cindy Kern: I was extremely happy with them and the core group that were in that those two, three years of project saying they are still with me every single month multiple times a month and are still engaging and the shit. They're producing now is off the hook.

287
00:35:42.780 --> 00:36:02.280
Cindy Kern: And I guess it would be equivalent to what we initially produced with roadkill that initial, it would be, it would be, it would be some of them would be equivalent to that. But of course that needed a lot to become what it is now. Right, so

288
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.120
Cindy Kern: practicing your two lessons learned.

289
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.480
Cindy Kern: What I I kept NGS X about 85%

290
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.800
Cindy Kern: There were aspects of the there were aspects of the

291
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:36.330
Cindy Kern: Were aspects of the I didn't follow the script at all. I USED MY EXPERIENCE FROM NEW TRAIN I use my experience from professional development and my own knowledge to fill that in, so I'm not gonna lie to you I didn't, I didn't use the script at all.

292
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.420
TJ McKenna: Um, you also didn't have a co facilitator, right.

293
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:49.440
TJ McKenna: Right, and so I I've often talked about the the screen with you know my work with the leadership development Academy and trying to help.

294
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.440
TJ McKenna: Help facilitators get better at, you know, beginning facilitators become more expert.

295
00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:03.780
TJ McKenna: I've often called the you know the screen, your, your third facilitator in the room like use that as your co facilitator.

296
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:10.380
TJ McKenna: You know, sometimes you're cheerleading for you know what Richard said. And sometimes you're arguing with like, wait.

297
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:27.000
TJ McKenna: You know, does you know when Molly says, you know, the blue ball goes down and that little bonito is like, you know, in Spanish, says iron it on a paste like does he really know that air has weight and went down. But he made this like crazy forehead. You know, like

298
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:41.610
TJ McKenna: He bought in and and so I wonder if if you felt like your use of NGOs X was a like that there was some usefulness for the fact that there was like another voice in the room.

299
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:56.280
Cindy Kern: Well, I will tell you 100% useful. Like, I don't want to. I'm not discounting the absolute like no 100% useful and I did use it very much like that. And I would say, you know, right now.

300
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.500
Cindy Kern: Right now.

301
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:13.950
Cindy Kern: I don't know the facilitator, whoever it was speaking at the time they're presenting this aspect. So I want you to think about that. I want to reflect on it. What are some ideas did a lot of big paper. So here are some big ideas now.

302
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:23.820
Cindy Kern: I don't hold the same I don't hold the same belief system here. So here is where I come from. And here's the research that supports that.

303
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:34.350
Cindy Kern: Let's negotiate that. And let's think about our own belief systems. And let's think about how this or what this looks like with fidelity. When we implement it.

304
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:46.740
Cindy Kern: So what aspects are coming from both of these perspective, both of which are research based, both of which are our sound pedagogical perspectives.

305
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:56.910
Cindy Kern: Where do they fall in your belief system and how do we support what we do in the classroom with research. How do we implemented with fidelity.

306
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:04.590
Cindy Kern: Where do we looking for here. Like what kind of in those type of discussions, what happened and that happened. Oftentimes, I'd be like,

307
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:19.500
Cindy Kern: Right here, I really struggle with the construct of air puppies. I struggle with the concept of air puppies because we never actually take the time to identify how this model fails.

308
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:29.520
Cindy Kern: And why it actually doesn't work and why it what what what it's what it's how we're not mapping it

309
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:39.900
Cindy Kern: We're not identifying we're only identifying why it's like this where we really need students to take the time in this case in that directly aligns to this grade level expectation

310
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:44.880
Cindy Kern: And this grade level expectation identifies that we can see the limitations of a model.

311
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:56.970
Cindy Kern: But who's doing the thinking here. And who do we want to identify how these things are like and not like like those would be key moments where I would go. Okay, so this is cool.

312
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:09.990
Cindy Kern: But if we have students go home and go, there's there's puppies around us all the time, instead of them being able to understand that we're using that as an analogy.

313
00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:20.130
Cindy Kern: Then we have to have them do the thinking about that the students do the thinking about that. So, like that. Those would be the little aspects. So yeah, like

314
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:27.270
Cindy Kern: If I saw something or when I saw, stuff like that. It would be like, I'm going to pause it here.

315
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:34.440
Cindy Kern: Or I'm going to let you go through this, we're going to talk about this aspect of it and we might watch the video again and say okay now.

316
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:43.860
Cindy Kern: What will we do in our classrooms to assure that students are a doing the grade level expectation associated with this be that they're doing the thinking

317
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:55.050
Cindy Kern: And that they understand the analogy for what's happening, not just the big concepts, but the analogy that we're using to explain the big concepts, so

318
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.470
TJ McKenna: It sounds like you're you're going through cycles of like

319
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:06.690
TJ McKenna: Almost leaning on NGOs X for a development stage or like learning more about this one piece or at least

320
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:14.580
TJ McKenna: You know, accessing new ideas. And then there was like a pause identified contradictions for you and for

321
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:22.530
TJ McKenna: Teachers to identify some of the things that they're seeing that, like, Wait, that doesn't look like my classroom or I, I didn't think about it that way or you know

322
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:36.810
TJ McKenna: That's not my belief system and how we would teach that topic. And then you'd cycle back to, like, you know, thinking about agency of, like, okay, so how do we do that in my. How do I do that. How do I do that for my students, you know all your teachers were experts.

323
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.460
TJ McKenna: Knowing where students

324
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:53.730
Cindy Kern: Or do I even do this with my students, I mean that was a huge jump. It's not how do I do this with my students for most of my teachers. It's, am I even doing this for my students, right, because we're talking

325
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.830
So they were

326
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:08.130
Cindy Kern: Right, so they were still in the when I talk about making the students thinking visible and I talk about engaging students in the analysis of these things in order to

327
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:19.980
Cindy Kern: Get to that they were like, no, you just give them the analogy, and they're good. No, no, no, that's not thinking that's not them understanding how we use analogies to explain the world right like

328
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:28.440
Cindy Kern: That's not them understanding we use how we use models to explain the world and to understand the world so like it even goes back to even

329
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:35.010
Cindy Kern: Even more like challenging the belief systems of the teachers through this of

330
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:46.020
Cindy Kern: Why is it important to do these things. Why is it important that students are doing the thinking there. Why is it important that and then truly understanding

331
00:42:46.500 --> 00:43:04.440
Cindy Kern: The set that the same time because the steps were completely like foreign to them right this the NGS s or projects projecting one and two were first time experience is just like new train first time experiences within GSA besides reading the website type of thing.

332
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:15.060
TJ McKenna: So did they say like, I'm not doing this, or was it in the posts of NGOs x or are you just reading the room or a combination of all three.

333
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.900
Cindy Kern: I don't really know what they put on

334
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.700
TJ McKenna: So how did you know like when we needed to pause the video.

335
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.920
TJ McKenna: And chat, because

336
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.170
Cindy Kern: A lot of reading the room. A lot of questions.

337
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:38.760
Cindy Kern: There was lots of stops and big papers and small group discussions to whole group discussions. There was a lot of time to negotiate.

338
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:58.350
Cindy Kern: Beliefs about teaching and beliefs about the constructs being presented associated with what students do so, like, I think we took. Do you remember how many days we took to do a new train

339
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.450
Cindy Kern: Like the first meeting.

340
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:13.740
TJ McKenna: I know when we got it down and got it down is kind of arbitrary, but when we started doing it at the Science Center. It was four and a half days beginning to finish. We could do it in four and a half days.

341
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:22.680
TJ McKenna: You know, and I have the breakdown and that involved. You know, there was homework and so you had to do some and pause and go to the next step. And so I wonder

342
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:32.130
TJ McKenna: Just generally like I i know the facilitators, I worked with were often concerned about, like, yes, that's a great question. But

343
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:42.750
TJ McKenna: Step three. We're going to do the and it was like the allowing time and I think some of the facilitators that I'm studying now that are that were more successful.

344
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:52.770
TJ McKenna: Saw like this is a question that has to come up now and we're talking about this now versus others. That's it. That's a great question. And I always think of

345
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.990
TJ McKenna: A former colleague of mine who her favorite thing was to say

346
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:10.080
TJ McKenna: She was all about the parking lot and we never went back and revisited the parking lot. And so, and she the very abrasive way would say that's a great question. Stick it in the parking lot and we would always joke like

347
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:17.070
TJ McKenna: She's saying, stick it up your parking lot, like she sounds like a question, put it outside. Get it. We're not talking about that.

348
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:26.610
TJ McKenna: Does, I don't know, like, four and a half days. If you were to break down your first cohort. I'm assuming it was a lot more than them.

349
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.390
Cindy Kern: Yeah. Well, we did a we did

350
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.640
Cindy Kern: Have our structure was a Monday, Tuesday,

351
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.830
Cindy Kern: Wednesday we know we met. We met Thursday, Friday.

352
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.960
Cindy Kern: High cognitive load anticipated by the end of the day Friday.

353
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:58.800
Cindy Kern: Which is what we shot for we want them to be mad at us and they wanted your belief systems to be rocked we wanted them to be questioning us questioning, I say us it was

354
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:13.770
Cindy Kern: One of them mad at me right so I wouldn't have met it NDS x i wanted to Matt and I say that lovingly, but I wanted them to be in a position of high cognitive load and discomfort. By the end of the day on Friday.

355
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:24.570
Cindy Kern: They had homework Saturday and Sunday, but they got to walk away, they got to sit in their discomfort for a couple of days, they got to have a couple of important

356
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:37.410
Cindy Kern: Targeted reads that came straight from NGS X that would support and challenge their thinking in those areas we came back Monday, Tuesday,

357
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.190
Cindy Kern: And Wednesday.

358
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:56.580
Cindy Kern: And we got through. I think I pull up my document, but I think we just got through the first two modules in that time. So the scheduling was a

359
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:07.410
Cindy Kern: Mix of we're doing new terrain. But then we're doing projects are doing NGOs X. But then we're doing project saying we're doing NGS X, but we're doing project sing.

360
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:13.170
Cindy Kern: And we spread that out over the course of the five days for the two modules.

361
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.290
Cindy Kern: Then we met in

362
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.930
Cindy Kern: September.

363
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.810
Cindy Kern: Of late fall

364
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.680
Cindy Kern: And then we met in January.

365
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.480
Cindy Kern: When we met in March and then we met in May.

366
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.680
Cindy Kern: And we finished up the modules.

367
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:54.750
Cindy Kern: And we did the other things we're talking about with projects in. And the goal was, here's your bite. Here's a bite at something we've given you a lot to think about. Now when you start your school year. How are you going to start with one of these

368
00:47:55.770 --> 00:48:06.210
Cindy Kern: Right. And one of the key things of course in in next gen is modeling so modeling is what a lot of people want us

369
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:17.640
Cindy Kern: My background is in argumentation like scaffolding first student engagement and argumentation and explanation. So

370
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:29.010
Cindy Kern: We did that model with Project sing the whole time and a lot of the people picked up most of the people picked up modeling, but many of them picked up.

371
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.700
Cindy Kern: argumentation as their as their protocol.

372
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:43.560
Cindy Kern: Which led to a lot of really interesting things as we went through the year, because they needed to understand that the they were so hell bent on a structure of argumentation, which

373
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:49.170
Cindy Kern: That's across all the literature, like we see Car. Car. Here's how we engage in argumentation, but

374
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:57.360
Cindy Kern: They forget the discourse feedback cursive nature of argumentation. And so that led to a whole new aspect that we had to

375
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:07.860
Cindy Kern: really dive into and project saying that really meant for a whole redesign of the second half of the year for projects but

376
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:27.750
Cindy Kern: They had they had a task to try and to bring back student work and to engage with part of it was what was what was facilitated by NGOs x part of it was facilitated by what like how we were going to do things based on what we were learning with Project saying

377
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:38.490
Cindy Kern: They would started the school year with it. And then we came back and we got to unpack everything like they got a day of mother.

378
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:49.290
Cindy Kern: Yes. Like, like, and they got to. We got to work together. We got to brainstorm together. We got to, that's when the the frustration of

379
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:57.390
Cindy Kern: This mind did not look anything like the video that they showed in N G Yeah, right, because it's September.

380
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:09.990
Cindy Kern: And that was June and there's evidence and I pulled the video up. I'm like look at the date. Look at the date like these are well trained kids that have engaged with this for nine months so

381
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:14.280
TJ McKenna: Pulling back the curtain, a little bit to Richard and Sarah in the back of that classroom.

382
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:21.600
TJ McKenna: And at certain times somebody that Molly would say something and Richard was a hold on time out and they would stop the video and he would say,

383
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:36.660
TJ McKenna: Try saying it like this okay record again and they would start again. And then they Molly would say and how do you know that and then the students would say, well, Baba baba baba baba BA and so like there, you know, is a little bit of lights, camera, action.

384
00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.210
TJ McKenna: On that video and

385
00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:40.590
Margaret Foster: We never knew

386
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.230
Cindy Kern: It. That's really rough

387
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.880
TJ McKenna: Because soon, Tony.

388
00:50:44.940 --> 00:51:03.540
Cindy Kern: The efficacy of a teacher to see something that is is perfectly executed with with classroom and say, Here's what the expectation is, but not understanding the amount of work or magic that goes into that.

389
00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:21.540
Cindy Kern: That like that has to be unpacked that we have to take care of the teachers as much as we have to take care of the students right like the you can't, you're not. There's not going to be a resilience and persistence in trying these things.

390
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.930
Cindy Kern: If the teachers are supported and understanding that this is a year long process.

391
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:39.540
Cindy Kern: Then, and then also understanding that my honors kids might, whatever you want to call them, but they are tracked my my honors kids are going to have this by October my

392
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:51.420
Cindy Kern: My general kids, whatever you want to call them will have this by January and my special ed kids, my, my lowest level class will will have the spy June.

393
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:56.520
Cindy Kern: Right will be like there's like you have like these are conversations that

394
00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.730
Cindy Kern: Are realistic.

395
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:19.560
Cindy Kern: About what the classroom is right and who the students are and allowing the stupid teachers to think about who their students are and set meaningful meaningful goals for them to meet these these grade level expectations and be able to have these skills and abilities like

396
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.430
Cindy Kern: You like those are those are

397
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.520
Cindy Kern: That's us taking care of the teachers.

398
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:28.140
TJ McKenna: Like well

399
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:29.160
Cindy Kern: With them.

400
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:37.260
TJ McKenna: Especially what we know with what happens to teachers during these like systemic reforms that like they're they're professionals.

401
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:46.590
TJ McKenna: They're doing great work. And then all of a sudden, some they the collective they say, Actually, we figured it out. You should change everything and do it this way.

402
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.290
TJ McKenna: And so, you know, that does rock.

403
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:56.340
TJ McKenna: A lot of the foundations of teachers when they're thinking about, like, Wait, I've been doing all this other stuff like that bad, my bad.

404
00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:08.490
TJ McKenna: And so the. The other thing is we're in this. We're talking a lot about scale like NGS X initially with the the hybrid model was about scale like how do we get

405
00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:15.030
TJ McKenna: How do we get facilitators to, like, you know, it's not a fidelity of implementation thing but it kind of is.

406
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:22.530
TJ McKenna: Like, how, how do we make the videos that are the things that might be too hard for them to be able to say, you know, the whoever

407
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:33.360
TJ McKenna: Takes up facilitation. On that day, and then how do we allow for that. What we also know about being responsive to individual teachers needs in the moment.

408
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:49.470
TJ McKenna: And so I wonder like, it seemed like you focus on two cohorts and project sing. And so what was your vision in terms of scale in your area for, like, this is a this is a project meant for thinking about scale but you seem to focus on

409
00:53:50.760 --> 00:54:02.100
TJ McKenna: Two cohorts that I know for a fact are still, you know, the they're still your loudest singers. They're, they're out and about and still really focused and they come to everything.

410
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:14.850
TJ McKenna: And so, like, did you when you're thinking about Project saying, Where was it like this project and then we'll see, or did you have a long longer term vision of, like, I want to create something and then these people are going to be my advocates.

411
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:16.110
Cindy Kern: Well,

412
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.040
Margaret Foster: To be sorry quick clarification question. Um, so

413
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:32.550
Margaret Foster: There, there is a year one cohort. And then those same participants came back for your to curriculum development, but there was also a new cohort, who are starting your that okay, sorry.

414
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:40.350
Cindy Kern: Go. We actually had we actually had a third year with Project sing that didn't like I didn't get it funded

415
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.450
Cindy Kern: So we didn't do NGS x

416
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:50.790
Cindy Kern: We did Cohort two year to Cohort one year three

417
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:51.570
Hmm.

418
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:53.940
Cindy Kern: So,

419
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:58.590
Margaret Foster: conferences where everybody would come back and be like, Look, what I'm doing, like,

420
00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.360
Margaret Foster: Yeah. Gotcha.

421
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.840
Yeah.

422
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:20.460
Cindy Kern: I will tell you, TJ. I'm like a lousy person when it comes to I'm a squirrel. Right. Like, am I in the moment person and project sing came to me as a mechanism to engage teachers.

423
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:43.620
Cindy Kern: I you if you looked at my planning for Project sing this so frickin detail oriented. And then, of course, as all the plans do it went in a different direction. So when this all started it was, how can I help teachers in this transition. And then as we move forward. And as we

424
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:52.260
Cindy Kern: As we worked to develop the skills and abilities of these teachers in the classroom.

425
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.670
Cindy Kern: The Community became the most important thing to me.

426
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:07.440
Cindy Kern: The community of of educators who were at many levels becoming

427
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:22.110
Cindy Kern: A unit that held the same belief systems and shared its community of practice, but the same resources, the same constructs are concepts of what it means to engage learners and to teach

428
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.360
Cindy Kern: To teach

429
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:37.020
Cindy Kern: The Community became very important to me, NGOs, X continue to support that and grew. Our, our cohort from Cohort one to Cohort two

430
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:53.190
Cindy Kern: And then I really went to. I really went in a didn't ever expect us because I've been a professional developer for 27 years and 20 now. Not that long.

431
00:56:53.670 --> 00:57:05.760
Cindy Kern: 25 years and so I never really thought that the unit that would be the most important thing because content and peace and K have always been so important to me.

432
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:18.570
Cindy Kern: That the community would be the most important thing because if we care for the teachers and we care about their experiences and we can support them with

433
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.580
Cindy Kern: An understanding of what teaching and learning. Miss and strategies are

434
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.910
Cindy Kern: And we can do it in a caring

435
00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:33.360
Cindy Kern: Critical environment, then we can do amazing things.

436
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:49.440
Cindy Kern: So my shift TJ, to be honest with you. It happened as I watched teachers go through a tremendous amount of struggle and tremendous amount of low like low support from the states and their districts

437
00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:56.580
Cindy Kern: A love and a desire to

438
00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:03.840
Cindy Kern: A lot of it had to grow in a lot of them, but a love and a desire for the students over anything else.

439
00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.440
Cindy Kern: And that that

440
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:19.830
Cindy Kern: Knowing that they needed support in those areas that became what is actually the most important thing to me is that community of learners. So the community of educators

441
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.650
Cindy Kern: That community so

442
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.310
Cindy Kern: Can I say I was looking for to be something bigger.

443
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:37.290
Cindy Kern: I had expectations walking out with my doctorate, and I had a model in which I wanted to follow through on through on in the first five years.

444
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:49.380
Cindy Kern: And I probably did the fatal flaw in in what it means to be in higher ed, which is I went from where all my training is at and where my where my

445
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:57.630
Cindy Kern: Trajectory was to know this is what feels like needs to happen and this is what feels right and

446
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:10.650
Cindy Kern: I'm going to move in this direction, so now i i just focus on that group of any group any teacher. We meet every Wednesday night still every Wednesday night, since Cove, it happened, we were

447
00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:16.860
Cindy Kern: In a webinar. We have anywhere from 12 to 35 teachers that come in and

448
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:21.390
Cindy Kern: We think about, we think about what it means to

449
00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:31.740
Cindy Kern: engage students and learning at home in science and we tried to negotiate, you know, 20 different school district policies and

450
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:43.260
Cindy Kern: Zero help from the state and they have a safe space where they know people are like minded and they're not going to bitch and complain, they're gonna they're going to think about what they can do for kids.

451
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:44.640
TJ McKenna: So awesome.

452
00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:52.860
TJ McKenna: Yeah, I've got an interview with the learning policy and Institute, so I gotta jump off right, Cindy. Thanks for the invite. On Wednesday nights.

453
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:54.270
Cindy Kern: Yeah.

454
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:56.880
Cindy Kern: You get it right.

455
00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.900
Cindy Kern: You're on our list.

456
00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:59.790
TJ McKenna: I don't think I am on the list.

457
01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.510
Cindy Kern: You have to be on the list. All right. Well, I'm

458
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:06.450
TJ McKenna: Better whenever there's the

TJ McKenna: unconference I get it from Todd and his peeps.

460
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:15.690
Cindy Kern: How are you on my list I I'm adding new to it, right now I'm literally typing.

461
01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:20.910
Margaret Foster: So,

462
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:26.070
Cindy Kern: I will tell you, it has digress to a lot of drinking lately, but it's still good. It's still

463
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.410
TJ McKenna: That we all have to survive.

464
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.270
TJ McKenna: Yeah. All right.
