[00:00:04.95];Margaret Foster; Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah. And are you drinking iced tea.
[00:00:11.16];Cindy Kern; I'm actually just drinking water down iced coffee.
[00:00:15.71];Margaret Foster; Ah, yeah. Yeah.
[00:00:17.60];Margaret Foster; I saying
[00:00:20.97];Cindy Kern; Yeah, I had a couple hot coffee this morning, my 830 meaning I switched over to iced coffee and I didn't refresh. Before I came in here. I just hopped out of one to another. So
[00:00:35.04];Margaret Foster; Running on coffee. Yep. Same
[00:00:38.64];Cindy Kern; It's not much different than my entire life.
[00:00:42.96];Margaret Foster; No, I'm saying I i've been amazed, like, wow, I'm probably just as busy is not just okay
[00:00:49.74];unclear;Right.
[00:00:52.11];Cindy Kern; Yeah, it's kind of insane. It's kind of insane. I actually, yeah, kind of insane but
[00:00:59.73];Cindy Kern; I guess new normals finding new normals.
[00:01:02.37];Cindy Kern; Yeah, yeah. Yep.
[00:01:05.01];Margaret Foster; Yeah, one
[00:01:06.78];Cindy Kern; Is TJ doing this or is it just us.
[00:01:09.03];Margaret Foster; To my knowledge, but I also want to be mindful of your time and I know it's only half an hour. This time, so we can go ahead and get started.
[00:01:16.59];Cindy Kern; And then whatever I'm waiting for TJ.
[00:01:19.11];Cindy Kern; And my next meeting this and until I think 11
[00:01:21.96];Margaret Foster; So, yeah.
[00:01:23.88];Cindy Kern; Yeah, I think I don't know what my next meeting is
[00:01:27.36];Cindy Kern; Yes 11
[00:01:28.71];unclear;So,
[00:01:30.27];Margaret Foster; Yeah, listen, she's not here, but like 1005 and I think we can
[00:01:37.71];Cindy Kern; Go for it. Sure. What's your
[00:01:40.50];Cindy Kern; What's your number one advice for
[00:01:45.24];Cindy Kern; Surviving TJ but Canada for surviving
[00:01:49.98];Cindy Kern; Isolation
[00:01:51.69];Margaret Foster; Oh,
[00:01:54.18];Margaret Foster; going outside.
[00:01:55.32];Cindy Kern; I think. Yeah. Beautiful right now.
[00:01:58.38];Margaret Foster; Yeah yeah and
[00:02:01.26];Margaret Foster; Like underrated. I don't know. I have a friend in Spain, and they're not allowed to leave their house and he's just kind of like, oh,
[00:02:09.75];Margaret Foster; Yeah, because, you know, it's so good. Like, you can still remember go out and stuff so
[00:02:17.13];Cindy Kern; I think definitely minus our garden.
[00:02:20.31];Cindy Kern; We have we neglected it for a good three years. Our son was a was a sport varsity athlete which from sophomore year, on which meant that he
[00:02:33.18];Cindy Kern; We didn't have a weekend ever. And so we totally neglected. Our, our garden for three years. And so the garden and building the chicken coop for baby chickens that we picked up the week, the week that this all started
[00:02:53.70];Cindy Kern; That that has been the that has been the secret to surviving isolation have been those two things. So we're going to plant on Thursday. So, but we have. I don't know if you miss this way, every table in our house. Can I, can we see this
[00:03:10.14];Cindy Kern; See all this
[00:03:11.16];Cindy Kern; Yeah, every, every person pretty much every flat surface in our house that has any kind of natural light associated with it.
[00:03:20.79];Cindy Kern; Has baby plants.
[00:03:24.84];Cindy Kern; growing on it. So yeah, yeah. But on the ground on Thursday.
[00:03:31.23];TJ McKenna; July licks my lilacs are out of control. They've exploded. They're my favorite
[00:03:35.91];TJ McKenna; And so they're
[00:03:36.81];TJ McKenna; They're all blooming right now. And so I just step on my deck cut a couple, but I'm in the pot. Bring them inside and like I literally opened the door for my bedroom. This morning, and it was lilacs.
[00:03:48.00];Cindy Kern; Oh, that's awesome.
[00:03:49.50];unclear;So,
[00:03:50.97];Margaret Foster; We
[00:03:51.39];Cindy Kern; Have to talk to separately TJ, because we have to lilac tree bushes things that we inherited with the house and we never had lilacs before and
[00:04:03.78];Cindy Kern; We get huge purple blossoms on one huge white blossoms on the other and but they look so damn on happy so like the flowers look awesome. But we'll have to talk about how to
[00:04:17.97];Cindy Kern; make them happier.
[00:04:18.96];TJ McKenna; The trick is you have to be really mean to them.
[00:04:21.93];TJ McKenna; Okay, they bloom better if you're mean to them. If you don't like mulch around them. You gotta like hack them back and not even like, you know, nice pruning and cut this in cut that like they like
[00:04:33.81];TJ McKenna; Parts broken off to like shape them because they get unruly. They look kind of woodsy very fast.
[00:04:39.78];Cindy Kern; And so yeah, exactly.
[00:04:41.46];TJ McKenna; Yeah, you have to be mean to them and they are like there there are wildly bunch. They're like, No, I'm coming back. I'm coming back.
[00:04:49.29];Cindy Kern; Then I
[00:04:49.95];TJ McKenna; Want to go that way. I
[00:04:52.08];Cindy Kern; Really respect Lee likes even more now.
[00:04:56.19];Cindy Kern; Just with up not
[00:04:58.56];TJ McKenna; Bad ass like you smell this.
[00:05:00.24];TJ McKenna; Smell this flower. That's because you broke my arm off.
[00:05:03.15];Cindy Kern; Yeah, I come back in a smell bad.
[00:05:06.18];TJ McKenna; Yes, in your face.
[00:05:11.25];unclear;You want allergies.
[00:05:18.03];Cindy Kern; Calling right up your nose.
[00:05:28.17];Cindy Kern; Um, yeah.
[00:05:33.87];Margaret Foster; So maybe nobody in your terrain lilacs as the thing that they want to read a curriculum, about which is unfortunate because it's called New terrain. So you would think.
[00:05:45.27];TJ McKenna; perfect segue. Yeah, perfect segue.
[00:05:47.10];Margaret Foster; Yeah, killing it. Yeah.
[00:05:48.42];Cindy Kern; I'm impressed.
[00:05:50.49];unclear;I'm impressed.
[00:05:52.83];Margaret Foster; So, oh, better either better. Okay, next time you can read a curriculum about how the lilacs grow back faster as part of your next professional development experience. But for now.
[00:06:04.32];Margaret Foster; No going back to I think roadkill was, um, but, so the last time we kind of talked a little bit about what brought you reach your projects, saying, I'm sorry, what brought you to new terrain.
[00:06:18.36];Margaret Foster; And then, but I think our biggest question this time is like what. What did you take from new terrain. So for Cindy and in Project saying what are the parts that
[00:06:30.06];Margaret Foster; What are the things from new terrain that you chuck that informed your experience there or were the things that you decided to not take that as kind of a critique or building on what you learned from new terrain and GJ it's
[00:06:45.87];TJ McKenna; Yeah, I think that's like there's in my mind. There's two chunks to that like
[00:06:51.69];TJ McKenna; You remember the first couple days where it was Mark when shuttle and Brian facilitating and then Susan Wilson gave a talk.
[00:06:59.97];TJ McKenna; And then gene was there and Sarah was there and there was like I don't know 6070 of us all in the room. Like, what was your, what was your take on the kickoff the new terrain, because you were saying last time.
[00:07:11.79];TJ McKenna; You know you're new to the area you were just like, I guess I'll be involved like that, that those first couple days to me. I think we're eye opening. And so I wonder your take, remembering back to the beginning.
[00:07:27.36];Cindy Kern; To be honest with you. It was very similar to some of the things that we had done in Las Vegas.
[00:07:34.26];Cindy Kern; Las Vegas is the fourth largest school district in the nation. So we're talking 350,000 students 200,000 teachers.
[00:07:46.77];Cindy Kern; Maybe a maybe 150,000 teachers. And so when we did mass PDs a room of
[00:07:56.31];Cindy Kern; You know 70 8100 teachers was not per se. It wasn't the norm, but it wasn't per se abstract idea for us.
[00:08:07.56];Cindy Kern; That that actually that that construct
[00:08:13.68];Cindy Kern; Made me feel
[00:08:16.32];Cindy Kern; Like I was
[00:08:18.00];Cindy Kern; Kind of made me feel like I was at home again to have a lot of people in the room, and a lot of what we would refer to as in our professional development work back in Vegas. You know, we have
[00:08:32.79];Cindy Kern; We all of us as a team had our parts in our places. And I was, it was easy for me to see that as a team, who was responsible for what and what they were doing. So it actually fit a professional development model that I understood and I lived for about 15 years
[00:08:52.47];Cindy Kern; So I think that from the structure, the PD. There was comforting.
[00:09:00.21];Cindy Kern; I, I am a kind of an asshole. And the idea that I'm constantly in those situations, thinking about how it could be better instead of living in the moment of
[00:09:13.23];Cindy Kern; What I'm learning from the people I'm thinking about how to improve the professional development. It's happening. So I always live in that space. So I think from day one through day done
[00:09:26.52];Cindy Kern; My goal was, how, how do I take this tweak this improve this nothing. It was bad, like, Please don't think that those words mean it's bad, it's just the recursive, it just a recursive design cycle.
[00:09:42.72];Cindy Kern; How do I, how do I do this in the future. And can I make it better.
[00:09:49.20];Cindy Kern; Is always part of my brain. So
[00:09:53.19];Cindy Kern; I don't know if I answered your question though we're not TJ.
[00:09:57.93];TJ McKenna; But I think the
[00:09:59.88];TJ McKenna; One of the things that I definitely walked away with was, you know, and I was new to the PD world. And so I was coming from the far other side of the room.
[00:10:09.57];TJ McKenna; But I knew my science and I, or at least I thought I did. And I remember driving home one day after like the air puppies and the, you know,
[00:10:19.86];TJ McKenna; Eric science doesn't suck kind of stuff thinking like, wait, wearing not entirely understand the content and and I
[00:10:29.64];TJ McKenna; I was still, I think I know aced everything I took every science test I, you know, was seen as the science guy.
[00:10:38.52];TJ McKenna; And still was like I am not sure that I like it kind of rattled my foundation and I found I felt that in the beginning. And I think that's what made me almost double down and get more excited about. It was like there's something here. Like, and I remember the same thing like
[00:10:56.04];TJ McKenna; Seeing things for the Michael I don't know that I would do it that way. But I also don't know much about the PD world.
[00:11:03.21];TJ McKenna; But I think I was re energized by the energy in the room, certain people that I met and kind of this focus to
[00:11:13.98];TJ McKenna; Almost the focus of like seeing the leadership, the people that were running stuff like trying to be reactive in the moment of like, I don't
[00:11:22.08];TJ McKenna; I don't think that went so well maybe we should do it this way, and like trying to be reactive to the group. And I don't know if you picked up on that as well. Or if that was just because I was new.
[00:11:32.49];Cindy Kern; It's interesting because I'm one of the metrics that we use since like 2008 with the and I'm sorry I'm bringing up Las Vegas so much but it's my it's my
[00:11:44.40];Cindy Kern; Analog for the neutering. One of the things that we did from 2008 was we always chose topics that all of us were uncomfortable with to dive in and to develop our professional like to do our professional developments around our to week to week
[00:12:03.84];Cindy Kern; Summer Institute's and then our year long, a synchronous
[00:12:10.14];Cindy Kern; Class work that was associated with it. So,
[00:12:14.52];Cindy Kern; Like I said, like this model you even think about the online delivery of it was new to me. But the overall model was something that
[00:12:24.00];Cindy Kern; Was not new to me at all. So the
[00:12:28.20];Cindy Kern; We always wanted to be in that exact space because if we were in that space that you're discussing TJ, we had the opportunity to a understand the learner.
[00:12:38.52];Cindy Kern; And be understand how since making and conceptual change, which was the model that we worked from and hence, of course we evolve over years, as we understand teaching, learning better but we understand those constructs, so
[00:12:55.50];Cindy Kern; I was energized by the idea that I was questioning myself and that something that it was appear to be so some bold was something that I could dive into and feel that sense of
[00:13:07.95];Cindy Kern; I'm, I'm excited to engage with us because I understand. I understand that this is going to end up being fun and my frustrations and my my lack of knowledge because I'm self regulated, because I have that drive is going to push me to understand that so much more
[00:13:27.66];Cindy Kern; There was one aspect of the design that I kept coming back to, and it's something that I've run into project saying was the concept in the construct of self regulation and self regulated learning learners.
[00:13:38.70];Cindy Kern; Because we anybody sitting in that room are self regulated, they are suffering learners, otherwise they wouldn't have made it that far. So how do we support students in this process.
[00:13:50.85];Cindy Kern; Through the development of their self regulation. Their, their efficacy. Their, their motivation, so on and so forth. So like that was a that was something I picked up on.
[00:14:03.00];Cindy Kern; Probably within the first couple days there was, okay, we're adult learners. We all have master's degrees or higher. This is stuff that we're interested in. Now, what are some of the
[00:14:14.22];Cindy Kern; pitfalls that we're going to come across with our kids. And how do we accentuate those things, or how do we scaffold those aspects to make sure that we have the kids engaged, which when you watch the videos from new terrain.
[00:14:27.30];Cindy Kern; Those aspects are in there, right, like when you see it and you see the teachers engaging with it and engaging with their students. They exist, but they're not made explicit
[00:14:37.71];Cindy Kern; So that's like, that was something I pulled out right away when I thought about when I was designing project saying that that would be a constant undercurrent for the teachers as they engaged with
[00:14:53.31];Cindy Kern; With NGOs x, it would be the part of the flavor of project saying
[00:15:00.42];Cindy Kern; And I picked it up because I watched it and I experienced it. And I engaged with IT IN NEW TRAIN
[00:15:06.45];Cindy Kern; Am I talking too much about Project sing or like the
[00:15:09.21];Cindy Kern; Service.
[00:15:10.17];TJ McKenna; And I think the like that self regulation led me right to thinking about the hubs and I was in the eastern hub. I don't know which HUB YOU WERE INVOLVED IN when we remember when we broke up from new terrain and we went into like those
[00:15:27.21];TJ McKenna; Mel facilitated the cell facilitated groups and
[00:15:30.54];TJ McKenna; Puppies. Yeah, it was a ghost.
[00:15:34.98];Cindy Kern; Like I had my own because I had people from all over the state.
[00:15:38.01];Cindy Kern; Because I had somebody else find people for me.
[00:15:41.04];TJ McKenna; But how did that. How did your hub experience go when you were like, okay, now you're going to facilitate day four, and you're going to do day five.
[00:15:51.69];TJ McKenna; And it might. I mean, it was very long ago but like kind of the takeaway from like this what you were talking about in Vegas. This model of like we all come together, we all work together in this in this big social group and now okay go learn it on your own.
[00:16:08.82];unclear;Um,
[00:16:11.31];Cindy Kern; Yeah, it was, it was that was an interesting, that was an interesting aspect and i think i think part of the
[00:16:19.20];Cindy Kern; The group that I worked with, I think part of what
[00:16:23.79];Cindy Kern; This kind of makes me sound like an asshole. And I don't mean to sound like an asshole. But I think part of the reason it worked was that there was an individual there who had
[00:16:36.99];Cindy Kern; The
[00:16:39.39];Cindy Kern; experience and knowledge of the teaching and learning aspects are learning and teaching aspects that were being put forward to keep them on a road that led to what the actual in game was does that
[00:16:53.28];Cindy Kern; Make sense like
[00:16:54.21];TJ McKenna; I'm guessing that
[00:16:56.22];Cindy Kern; At the time it was nice. Yeah.
[00:16:57.90];TJ McKenna; Were there.
[00:16:58.47];TJ McKenna; When I was there anybody else like another higher ed person in your hub. No, no. Yeah. And that was like mine Eastern was, I think we had
[00:17:10.77];TJ McKenna; Three it folks and then maybe two or three that were not. And so there was like a power dynamics that was very interesting in our hub and I just never heard about a different how a win or as I
[00:17:26.91];Cindy Kern; Know we had, I had three and 14
[00:17:31.35];Cindy Kern; I had for teachers and myself.
[00:17:34.68];Cindy Kern; And when they would facilitate
[00:17:38.25];Cindy Kern; When they would facilitate the discussion or they facilitate what was going on.
[00:17:43.71];Cindy Kern; I mean, just like any of us do. It's not like I took over and said, but why it was like okay so let's steer in this direction because
[00:17:52.56];Cindy Kern; I mean my entire doctoral work was based on Brian's like not based but I read all of Brian's work. I knew where he was coming from. I read all of, like, I read a ton of G moon stuff I read a ton of, like, it's not like I i was coming in.
[00:18:09.06];Cindy Kern; Not knowing what their endgame was because I had experienced it through my doctoral program right so
[00:18:18.33];Cindy Kern; Like I was able to do that. And that was it was done with them left and leadership role and just with good moves, good stuff that we all talk about but
[00:18:33.90];Cindy Kern; I worried with an i apologize. Come back to project sing. But one of the design issues that I had was, when you have a group of five teachers that are doing these things by themselves sitting in their, in their schools.
[00:18:48.51];Cindy Kern; How much does it turn into a bitch session.
[00:18:53.22];Cindy Kern; excuse my language. But how often is it turned to a bitch session or how long, how often does it lead to stew teachers using the context of NGOs to draw the conclusions they already have
[00:19:06.99];Cindy Kern; And how to mitigate that I would be interested to see and hear how NGS X actually kind of worked through that and how they facilitated THAT BECAUSE WE WE KNOW I LOVE teachers, but we know that
[00:19:27.72];Cindy Kern; We do that right. We're going to see how the evidence fits our belief system and
[00:19:34.77];Cindy Kern; So, and we do have our own belief systems about how to teach and learn. So, um,
[00:19:42.93];Cindy Kern; Yeah, so that's
[00:19:45.39];TJ McKenna; What I remembered like skipping forward to that. I think it's, I don't know if it's a new terrain part two, or whatever. But like when we started building the curriculum materials. I remember Team Awesome. We once we formed we the I remember you saying to and I cannot remember
[00:20:05.61];TJ McKenna; My claims of the teachers. Oh.
[00:20:08.70];TJ McKenna; Are our two Roadkill
[00:20:11.88];Cindy Kern; Why can't remember their names.
[00:20:13.77];TJ McKenna; I'm spacing on it, but the
[00:20:16.44];TJ McKenna; The one that was like holding her textbook so tight. And I remember you like buying it from her hands and saying, I'm just going to put it under your chair.
[00:20:26.28];TJ McKenna; You can have it. You can have it whenever you need it, but I'm going to put it under your chair because like for her. That was everything. And it was like, well, let's just
[00:20:35.10];TJ McKenna; Open it up and and you know we started with a blank piece of paper and I know a lot of groups kind of went in different directions, but we
[00:20:41.61];TJ McKenna; I remember that vividly remember the conversation of, like, well you asking them, what do you want to teach
[00:20:47.46];TJ McKenna; And they said, you know, matter, energy and matter of fruit ecosystems. We're like, All right, well what's problematic about that and you know they very much wanted to do the
[00:20:57.06];TJ McKenna; You know the bunnies eat the grass, the hockey. The bunnies and like there's some sunshine. Like, that's an ecosystem. We were like, I'm not exactly like we're missing some elements and you
[00:21:08.91];TJ McKenna; Know, listen, Jay.
[00:21:10.98];unclear;Jay,
[00:21:12.99];TJ McKenna; And I, and so I remember, like, I think that whole first day we just like opened it up for dialogue and discourse and thinking about, like, like what's what's messed up with that and I think I even have a picture of our, you know, our first
[00:21:29.13];TJ McKenna; Paper.
[00:21:29.88];Cindy Kern; Where we were
[00:21:30.81];TJ McKenna; You know we we ended up with like, well, we need to like pause this, because this is so fluid.
[00:21:35.94];TJ McKenna; And like we need something that can represent the entire ecosystem. And that was how we were like when you know when roadkill and something gets hit
[00:21:43.29];TJ McKenna; It's like a timeout and like we can think about where that came from and where that when and and we've we've had a lot of discussions.
[00:21:51.63];TJ McKenna; Maggie and Jean and I about like, why did that, like, how did we go in that direction. And, you know, hash it out and it wasn't easy. We we hit lots of walls, but other groups kind of floundered
[00:22:06.63];Cindy Kern; I think part of that is like and kind of kind of sound like an asshole. Again, but I'm like, I think about at that point I had been teaching curriculum design for 10 years right and
[00:22:25.38];Cindy Kern; I've, I've managed a lot of personalities in that in those scenarios. Right. I was so incredibly grateful for having a content expert in there, not that I'm I don't think I can do a middle school ecosystems, but
[00:22:47.01];Cindy Kern; The the
[00:22:50.85];Cindy Kern; Like having like first of all we had. We had individuals who are willing to give it a go.
[00:22:56.82];Cindy Kern; Right. Second of all, we worked on unpacking where their knowledge was at and where they felt their strengths were at. And then we were able to question especially
[00:23:06.84];Cindy Kern; When you as a content expert and myself having content knowledge, we were able to question and ask the same type of questions and probing questions that we would ask kids like
[00:23:17.91];Cindy Kern; What's happening here. Why is it happening like not just not just it happens. But how and the why. So we literally took them through
[00:23:29.97];Cindy Kern; In an in a design and a unit design. We took them through what they would have to know in order to say they they did it. We did a causal explanation prior to
[00:23:43.47];Cindy Kern; Getting too far into all we're going to do this collectivity, we're going to do this collectivity, which is great for some teachers, but if you don't know why you're doing it then.
[00:23:52.68];Cindy Kern; You put it in there and then you try to backwards design it. Well, let's think about what we really want to know. And really what the kids have to understand
[00:24:01.20];Cindy Kern; And then let's think of all the different resources that we have and that we've used in that are awesome.
[00:24:06.27];Cindy Kern; And let's take the ones out that don't apply to exactly what they need to know and then let's think about where they go in there.
[00:24:12.48];Cindy Kern; And that's kind of how we did it. And when we didn't have when we had something that didn't have an activity, then we said, what could we do
[00:24:20.40];Cindy Kern; Well um you drew on this. I do understand I think about the loss of heat like energy. Energy transfer and the very idea of the the thermometer in I don't even know if it's in the new one. But we had talked about the thermometer in the mitten.
[00:24:38.43];Cindy Kern; And it's a monitor in the hand with them and then the difference between those
[00:24:42.42];Cindy Kern; But like, because we knew that this was an important thing where we don't just say energy is lost to the system.
[00:24:48.27];Cindy Kern; But we have
[00:24:49.17];Cindy Kern; Students collect evidence about it. We said, nope. We need a concrete experience where students get the opportunity to see
[00:24:55.95];Cindy Kern; To actually make sense of something that is a theory. Oh, when we say energy is lost to the system. So I think that we spent time with their prior knowledge. I think we spent time probing and
[00:25:10.14];Cindy Kern; Poking and teasing out
[00:25:15.87];Cindy Kern; Ideas that they were, they didn't spend time thinking about the How're the why, how the observable cousins. The observable.
[00:25:25.86];Cindy Kern; And once they had a picture of it. They are they are amazing educators. So once they saw the whole picture and what the end game look like even though we didn't all have a really good
[00:25:42.00];Cindy Kern; grasp of what the standard was asking us, because it was meant to be a sixth grade and that being a fifth grade, I think that in the long run. They understood how to what has to happen in order to develop something over time is. I think that's what I think happened.
[00:25:58.98];Cindy Kern; Hmm. There's a lot of talking, you say, TJ. I feel like you're interviewing me. TJ.
[00:26:03.39];Cindy Kern; And this is this supposed to be like a group fucking thing.
[00:26:05.43];Cindy Kern; What are you doing here.
[00:26:08.52];TJ McKenna; I mean, I remember it in a very similar way. And I think that like the managing personalities thing was kind of part of it because I remember
[00:26:17.73];TJ McKenna; Driving. You know, I think it was like a, you know, hour and a half for me, which is a long time and a jeep. That was lifted and had some wobble issues.
[00:26:27.60];TJ McKenna; My previous Jeep new Jeep fine old GI problems and but I like was so excited to get there. And I remember so many weekends, we get there. And they'd be like, Okay, go.
[00:26:39.27];TJ McKenna; Do it. We're like, what, and like I remember so many groups being like, what are we supposed to. How do we start. Where are we and
[00:26:47.49];TJ McKenna; I remember we were like Team Awesome Game on. Let's do it. Where are we, you know, and we would just get after it and like you know we weren't, we weren't working in a linear fashion.
[00:26:56.97];TJ McKenna; But we were always working on something and I remember we would get kind of stalled at the table as we move to the window and we go to the window and we start working in the window.
[00:27:06.78];Cindy Kern; No quick
[00:27:07.56];unclear;Yep.
[00:27:09.60];Cindy Kern; Oh shit, okay.
[00:27:11.52];Cindy Kern; I can sound like my house was falling apart.
[00:27:14.91];Cindy Kern; And the, the laundry room is right below me and it was off set pals on spin cycle.
[00:27:23.85];TJ McKenna; I was like, Oh my God, my
[00:27:25.53];Cindy Kern; House is falling down. Okay, sorry.
[00:27:27.06];TJ McKenna; It's a whole different phenomenon right there.
[00:27:29.07];TJ McKenna; Yeah, you gotta balance hotels, just like a good equation I'm
[00:27:33.54];Cindy Kern; Sorry, back to back to
[00:27:35.25];TJ McKenna; So we were moving around and you know in different places, just to make sure we were always making progress. And I think sometimes we were getting stuck.
[00:27:42.33];TJ McKenna; And so I think, you know, looking at the time, like. So based on this entire insane process starting from the massive group going into these hubs then moving into the small group curriculum work over the sustained time like were there.
[00:27:57.63];TJ McKenna; One or two key elements that you felt like were necessary for Project sing. Have you already thought through project, saying, or like kind of where what was the genesis of that project. And then what did you choose were nuggets that you were like this has got to be in there but not that
[00:28:16.50];Margaret Foster; Also, I just, I'm okay to stay on a little bit past 1030 and I think Cindy said she was
[00:28:21.57];Margaret Foster; So I'm not sure about your schedule as well. Teach. So we're going to put that out there.
[00:28:28.05];Cindy Kern; Or yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Till 11 and I don't want to go to the 11 o'clock meeting so I'm
[00:28:33.75];TJ McKenna; About 11 o'clock. But then somebody else or just asked me to spend 15 minutes on a on a survey pre that so that we could send it out on a different paper like how to school just ended, and now I'm busier. How did that happen. Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:49.05];Cindy Kern; Summer School started this week.
[00:28:50.46];Cindy Kern; And I have three classes the session.
[00:28:52.80];TJ McKenna; Doing three during summer session.
[00:28:55.89];TJ McKenna; Ended
[00:28:57.84];Cindy Kern; Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:28:59.10];TJ McKenna; Oh,
[00:29:00.39];Cindy Kern; Yeah, it's gonna it's gonna be a
[00:29:03.06];Cindy Kern; Co.
[00:29:04.59];Cindy Kern; Pastor so
[00:29:08.16];Cindy Kern; The
[00:29:10.44];Cindy Kern; question you asked related back to project sing.
[00:29:15.39];Cindy Kern; But I actually don't know what you asked me.
[00:29:18.06];TJ McKenna; Just basically like the new terrain was literally new terrain. For me it was like such a, like a different thing that there was like this massive launch that was kind of all over the place.
[00:29:28.71];TJ McKenna; And then like a refining down into these hubs that also, like, remember we came back and we did our share out some, like, wow. Everybody had drastically different experiences.
[00:29:37.02];TJ McKenna; And then we were all kind of locked in a room to build curriculum and still within that everybody had drastically different experiences. And so I wonder at
[00:29:45.39];TJ McKenna; WHAT POINT DID YOU DID project saying come to you and I'm sure it's over, you know, iterations of thinking about it, but like what elements from new train where you're like, that's that part. I gotta do, but that stuff. I'm not doing
[00:29:59.49];Cindy Kern; Keep sound like an asshole.
[00:30:02.73];TJ McKenna; You will not
[00:30:04.08];Cindy Kern; You promise TJ.
[00:30:05.58];Cindy Kern; Maybe doesn't know me as well as you know me.
[00:30:07.44];Cindy Kern; Making my think she's an asshole.
[00:30:10.32];TJ McKenna; The whole point of this
[00:30:11.70];TJ McKenna; Is, you know, we're we're writing up the case and the case need like can't be an ad for NGOs acts.
[00:30:19.83];TJ McKenna; Like we want other states to see this is how messy. It was to try to scale this because, you know, we're also going into the work at the Science Center, and there were major fatal flaws in that work too. And so we're just trying to paint the whole picture.
[00:30:36.36];Cindy Kern; Okay, so
[00:30:37.38];TJ McKenna; And when in a direction that was positive. And so, you know, how did you do that, how did you negotiate the elements that you felt like weren't successful and the elements that you felt like were wasted time
[00:30:50.97];Cindy Kern; Okay, so the
[00:30:55.35];Cindy Kern; The structure that I kept about 85% intact was NGS x
[00:31:06.99];Cindy Kern; The facilitation of it over the course of
[00:31:11.76];Cindy Kern; A year, twice, so I had to one year cycles was
[00:31:19.59];Cindy Kern; Very different.
[00:31:23.04];Cindy Kern; We didn't get to curriculum design until second year, we spent a longer period of time on on NGOs sucks targeting and then we did NGOs at but I it's my time was also spent with them on, like I said,
[00:31:45.00];Cindy Kern; engaging students and self regulated learners through the process.
[00:31:50.49];Cindy Kern; Really developing and thinking more succinctly about how the strategies that were demonstrated in GFX actually take time and
[00:32:03.66];Cindy Kern; Time and training, I'll say teaching to how to how to do the strategies that are in NGS x. And so we unpack
[00:32:12.63];unclear;Each of those
[00:32:15.33];Cindy Kern; The frustration for a teacher who doesn't understand how to do something and they see an exemplar
[00:32:21.15];Cindy Kern; That has June 10 have a great summer on the video behind them and the students do it perfectly, and they're trying to do it in September and they don't understand well they're not
[00:32:31.62];Cindy Kern; Why their students are doing this and then having to work through teacher efficacy in understanding locus of control and where it lies throughout the throughout the school year.
[00:32:43.44];Cindy Kern; Where it's heavily, heavily teacher scaffold it and how the scaffolds are removed throughout the year, so the kids can engage that way into year
[00:32:53.37];Cindy Kern; Spending time
[00:32:56.55];Cindy Kern; Not just thinking about why these things are important and what they look like, but how you get kids to those steps was a lot of projects thing.
[00:33:07.17];Cindy Kern; So we would meet to do
[00:33:12.33];Cindy Kern; The modules which we only did I think one module individually.
[00:33:18.06];Cindy Kern; I can't remember which one it was. But we only did one module individually. So they did it at their hub. I felt comfortable with what they had to do with it. I felt like there wasn't a lot of latitude.
[00:33:31.56];Cindy Kern; And so we did that one individually, and we did all the other ones I facilitated with them throughout the year. And then we had additional days where we did nothing with NGOs X and all we did was, think about scaffolding student engagement.
[00:33:48.09];Cindy Kern; From early skill development through, I can do this sap.
[00:33:54.45];Cindy Kern; Excuse me I'm turning away from you guys like it's any less loud or any less as I coughed. That was funny.
[00:34:00.57];Cindy Kern; Anyways, um,
[00:34:02.49];Cindy Kern; So we spent a lot of time.
[00:34:09.09];Cindy Kern; With all like every single meeting every single thing that we did had a self regulate self regulation aspect to it are deep dives into strategies and looks of strategies over time and scaffold strategies over time.
[00:34:25.53];Cindy Kern; Those, those were the major changes for Project sing your one project seeing your to
[00:34:34.80];Cindy Kern; The second the for the people who are in projects in one they took the year and we we scaffold did
[00:34:45.15];Cindy Kern; curriculum development and I will tell you that I wasn't happy with the curriculum development. I wasn't as happy with my my
[00:34:55.62];Cindy Kern; I didn't get the products I wanted to get and part of it was I had 20 people and I had one of me and it if there wasn't enough of the pushing and the teasing and that would happen with a larger group of people engaging in that. Don't get me wrong for
[00:35:16.32];Cindy Kern; They've been engaging with in GFS for a year.
[00:35:21.42];Cindy Kern; They were buying far
[00:35:24.90];Cindy Kern; I was extremely happy with them and the core group that were in that those two, three years of project saying they are still with me every single month multiple times a month and are still engaging and the shit. They're producing now is off the hook.
[00:35:42.78];Cindy Kern; And I guess it would be equivalent to what we initially produced with roadkill that initial, it would be, it would be, it would be some of them would be equivalent to that. But of course that needed a lot to become what it is now. Right, so
[00:36:03.51];Cindy Kern; practicing your two lessons learned.
[00:36:08.64];Cindy Kern; What I I kept NGS X about 85%
[00:36:14.01];Cindy Kern; There were aspects of the there were aspects of the
[00:36:19.98];Cindy Kern; Were aspects of the I didn't follow the script at all. I USED MY EXPERIENCE FROM NEW TRAIN I use my experience from professional development and my own knowledge to fill that in, so I'm not gonna lie to you I didn't, I didn't use the script at all.
[00:36:36.48];TJ McKenna; Um, you also didn't have a co facilitator, right.
[00:36:40.05];TJ McKenna; Right, and so I I've often talked about the the screen with you know my work with the leadership development Academy and trying to help.
[00:36:50.34];TJ McKenna; Help facilitators get better at, you know, beginning facilitators become more expert.
[00:36:55.74];TJ McKenna; I've often called the you know the screen, your, your third facilitator in the room like use that as your co facilitator.
[00:37:04.08];TJ McKenna; You know, sometimes you're cheerleading for you know what Richard said. And sometimes you're arguing with like, wait.
[00:37:10.71];TJ McKenna; You know, does you know when Molly says, you know, the blue ball goes down and that little bonito is like, you know, in Spanish, says iron it on a paste like does he really know that air has weight and went down. But he made this like crazy forehead. You know, like
[00:37:28.26];TJ McKenna; He bought in and and so I wonder if if you felt like your use of NGOs X was a like that there was some usefulness for the fact that there was like another voice in the room.
[00:37:42.36];Cindy Kern; Well, I will tell you 100% useful. Like, I don't want to. I'm not discounting the absolute like no 100% useful and I did use it very much like that. And I would say, you know, right now.
[00:37:57.54];Cindy Kern; Right now.
[00:38:02.07];Cindy Kern; I don't know the facilitator, whoever it was speaking at the time they're presenting this aspect. So I want you to think about that. I want to reflect on it. What are some ideas did a lot of big paper. So here are some big ideas now.
[00:38:15.24];Cindy Kern; I don't hold the same I don't hold the same belief system here. So here is where I come from. And here's the research that supports that.
[00:38:24.42];Cindy Kern; Let's negotiate that. And let's think about our own belief systems. And let's think about how this or what this looks like with fidelity. When we implement it.
[00:38:34.83];Cindy Kern; So what aspects are coming from both of these perspective, both of which are research based, both of which are our sound pedagogical perspectives.
[00:38:48.69];Cindy Kern; Where do they fall in your belief system and how do we support what we do in the classroom with research. How do we implemented with fidelity.
[00:38:58.83];Cindy Kern; Where do we looking for here. Like what kind of in those type of discussions, what happened and that happened. Oftentimes, I'd be like,
[00:39:05.13];Cindy Kern; Right here, I really struggle with the construct of air puppies. I struggle with the concept of air puppies because we never actually take the time to identify how this model fails.
[00:39:20.01];Cindy Kern; And why it actually doesn't work and why it what what what it's what it's how we're not mapping it
[00:39:30.03];Cindy Kern; We're not identifying we're only identifying why it's like this where we really need students to take the time in this case in that directly aligns to this grade level expectation
[00:39:40.29];Cindy Kern; And this grade level expectation identifies that we can see the limitations of a model.
[00:39:45.33];Cindy Kern; But who's doing the thinking here. And who do we want to identify how these things are like and not like like those would be key moments where I would go. Okay, so this is cool.
[00:39:57.69];Cindy Kern; But if we have students go home and go, there's there's puppies around us all the time, instead of them being able to understand that we're using that as an analogy.
[00:40:11.01];Cindy Kern; Then we have to have them do the thinking about that the students do the thinking about that. So, like that. Those would be the little aspects. So yeah, like
[00:40:21.51];Cindy Kern; If I saw something or when I saw, stuff like that. It would be like, I'm going to pause it here.
[00:40:28.05];Cindy Kern; Or I'm going to let you go through this, we're going to talk about this aspect of it and we might watch the video again and say okay now.
[00:40:34.89];Cindy Kern; What will we do in our classrooms to assure that students are a doing the grade level expectation associated with this be that they're doing the thinking
[00:40:44.64];Cindy Kern; And that they understand the analogy for what's happening, not just the big concepts, but the analogy that we're using to explain the big concepts, so
[00:40:56.10];TJ McKenna; It sounds like you're you're going through cycles of like
[00:40:59.46];TJ McKenna; Almost leaning on NGOs X for a development stage or like learning more about this one piece or at least
[00:41:07.08];TJ McKenna; You know, accessing new ideas. And then there was like a pause identified contradictions for you and for
[00:41:14.88];TJ McKenna; Teachers to identify some of the things that they're seeing that, like, Wait, that doesn't look like my classroom or I, I didn't think about it that way or you know
[00:41:22.98];TJ McKenna; That's not my belief system and how we would teach that topic. And then you'd cycle back to, like, you know, thinking about agency of, like, okay, so how do we do that in my. How do I do that. How do I do that for my students, you know all your teachers were experts.
[00:41:37.23];TJ McKenna; Knowing where students
[00:41:39.24];Cindy Kern; Or do I even do this with my students, I mean that was a huge jump. It's not how do I do this with my students for most of my teachers. It's, am I even doing this for my students, right, because we're talking
[00:41:55.23];unclear;So they were
[00:41:56.91];Cindy Kern; Right, so they were still in the when I talk about making the students thinking visible and I talk about engaging students in the analysis of these things in order to
[00:42:08.52];Cindy Kern; Get to that they were like, no, you just give them the analogy, and they're good. No, no, no, that's not thinking that's not them understanding how we use analogies to explain the world right like
[00:42:20.58];Cindy Kern; That's not them understanding we use how we use models to explain the world and to understand the world so like it even goes back to even
[00:42:29.64];Cindy Kern; Even more like challenging the belief systems of the teachers through this of
[00:42:35.64];Cindy Kern; Why is it important to do these things. Why is it important that students are doing the thinking there. Why is it important that and then truly understanding
[00:42:46.50];Cindy Kern; The set that the same time because the steps were completely like foreign to them right this the NGS s or projects projecting one and two were first time experience is just like new train first time experiences within GSA besides reading the website type of thing.
[00:43:05.25];TJ McKenna; So did they say like, I'm not doing this, or was it in the posts of NGOs x or are you just reading the room or a combination of all three.
[00:43:17.28];Cindy Kern; I don't really know what they put on
[00:43:21.06];TJ McKenna; So how did you know like when we needed to pause the video.
[00:43:24.06];TJ McKenna; And chat, because
[00:43:25.98];Cindy Kern; A lot of reading the room. A lot of questions.
[00:43:28.89];Cindy Kern; There was lots of stops and big papers and small group discussions to whole group discussions. There was a lot of time to negotiate.
[00:43:39.48];Cindy Kern; Beliefs about teaching and beliefs about the constructs being presented associated with what students do so, like, I think we took. Do you remember how many days we took to do a new train
[00:43:59.34];Cindy Kern; Like the first meeting.
[00:44:00.81];TJ McKenna; I know when we got it down and got it down is kind of arbitrary, but when we started doing it at the Science Center. It was four and a half days beginning to finish. We could do it in four and a half days.
[00:44:14.49];TJ McKenna; You know, and I have the breakdown and that involved. You know, there was homework and so you had to do some and pause and go to the next step. And so I wonder
[00:44:23.25];TJ McKenna; Just generally like I i know the facilitators, I worked with were often concerned about, like, yes, that's a great question. But
[00:44:32.76];TJ McKenna; Step three. We're going to do the and it was like the allowing time and I think some of the facilitators that I'm studying now that are that were more successful.
[00:44:43.56];TJ McKenna; Saw like this is a question that has to come up now and we're talking about this now versus others. That's it. That's a great question. And I always think of
[00:44:53.64];TJ McKenna; A former colleague of mine who her favorite thing was to say
[00:44:58.62];TJ McKenna; She was all about the parking lot and we never went back and revisited the parking lot. And so, and she the very abrasive way would say that's a great question. Stick it in the parking lot and we would always joke like
[00:45:10.56];TJ McKenna; She's saying, stick it up your parking lot, like she sounds like a question, put it outside. Get it. We're not talking about that.
[00:45:19.32];TJ McKenna; Does, I don't know, like, four and a half days. If you were to break down your first cohort. I'm assuming it was a lot more than them.
[00:45:27.45];Cindy Kern; Yeah. Well, we did a we did
[00:45:31.77];Cindy Kern; Have our structure was a Monday, Tuesday,
[00:45:37.38];Cindy Kern; Wednesday we know we met. We met Thursday, Friday.
[00:45:42.75];Cindy Kern; High cognitive load anticipated by the end of the day Friday.
[00:45:47.04];Cindy Kern; Which is what we shot for we want them to be mad at us and they wanted your belief systems to be rocked we wanted them to be questioning us questioning, I say us it was
[00:46:00.06];Cindy Kern; One of them mad at me right so I wouldn't have met it NDS x i wanted to Matt and I say that lovingly, but I wanted them to be in a position of high cognitive load and discomfort. By the end of the day on Friday.
[00:46:14.52];Cindy Kern; They had homework Saturday and Sunday, but they got to walk away, they got to sit in their discomfort for a couple of days, they got to have a couple of important
[00:46:25.41];Cindy Kern; Targeted reads that came straight from NGS X that would support and challenge their thinking in those areas we came back Monday, Tuesday,
[00:46:40.20];Cindy Kern; And Wednesday.
[00:46:42.24];Cindy Kern; And we got through. I think I pull up my document, but I think we just got through the first two modules in that time. So the scheduling was a
[00:46:57.51];Cindy Kern; Mix of we're doing new terrain. But then we're doing projects are doing NGOs X. But then we're doing project saying we're doing NGS X, but we're doing project sing.
[00:47:08.67];Cindy Kern; And we spread that out over the course of the five days for the two modules.
[00:47:14.22];Cindy Kern; Then we met in
[00:47:18.00];Cindy Kern; September.
[00:47:20.64];Cindy Kern; Of late fall
[00:47:23.49];Cindy Kern; And then we met in January.
[00:47:27.66];Cindy Kern; When we met in March and then we met in May.
[00:47:32.28];Cindy Kern; And we finished up the modules.
[00:47:36.87];Cindy Kern; And we did the other things we're talking about with projects in. And the goal was, here's your bite. Here's a bite at something we've given you a lot to think about. Now when you start your school year. How are you going to start with one of these
[00:47:55.77];Cindy Kern; Right. And one of the key things of course in in next gen is modeling so modeling is what a lot of people want us
[00:48:09.63];Cindy Kern; My background is in argumentation like scaffolding first student engagement and argumentation and explanation. So
[00:48:20.61];Cindy Kern; We did that model with Project sing the whole time and a lot of the people picked up most of the people picked up modeling, but many of them picked up.
[00:48:30.03];Cindy Kern; argumentation as their as their protocol.
[00:48:34.35];Cindy Kern; Which led to a lot of really interesting things as we went through the year, because they needed to understand that the they were so hell bent on a structure of argumentation, which
[00:48:44.10];Cindy Kern; That's across all the literature, like we see Car. Car. Here's how we engage in argumentation, but
[00:48:49.68];Cindy Kern; They forget the discourse feedback cursive nature of argumentation. And so that led to a whole new aspect that we had to
[00:48:58.05];Cindy Kern; really dive into and project saying that really meant for a whole redesign of the second half of the year for projects but
[00:49:08.70];Cindy Kern; They had they had a task to try and to bring back student work and to engage with part of it was what was what was facilitated by NGOs x part of it was facilitated by what like how we were going to do things based on what we were learning with Project saying
[00:49:28.77];Cindy Kern; They would started the school year with it. And then we came back and we got to unpack everything like they got a day of mother.
[00:49:40.29];Cindy Kern; Yes. Like, like, and they got to. We got to work together. We got to brainstorm together. We got to, that's when the the frustration of
[00:49:50.01];Cindy Kern; This mind did not look anything like the video that they showed in N G Yeah, right, because it's September.
[00:49:58.26];Cindy Kern; And that was June and there's evidence and I pulled the video up. I'm like look at the date. Look at the date like these are well trained kids that have engaged with this for nine months so
[00:50:10.23];TJ McKenna; Pulling back the curtain, a little bit to Richard and Sarah in the back of that classroom.
[00:50:14.55];TJ McKenna; And at certain times somebody that Molly would say something and Richard was a hold on time out and they would stop the video and he would say,
[00:50:21.93];TJ McKenna; Try saying it like this okay record again and they would start again. And then they Molly would say and how do you know that and then the students would say, well, Baba baba baba baba BA and so like there, you know, is a little bit of lights, camera, action.
[00:50:37.41];TJ McKenna; On that video and
[00:50:40.11];Margaret Foster; We never knew
[00:50:41.85];Cindy Kern; It. That's really rough
[00:50:43.98];TJ McKenna; Because soon, Tony.
[00:50:44.94];Cindy Kern; The efficacy of a teacher to see something that is is perfectly executed with with classroom and say, Here's what the expectation is, but not understanding the amount of work or magic that goes into that.
[00:51:04.53];Cindy Kern; That like that has to be unpacked that we have to take care of the teachers as much as we have to take care of the students right like the you can't, you're not. There's not going to be a resilience and persistence in trying these things.
[00:51:23.16];Cindy Kern; If the teachers are supported and understanding that this is a year long process.
[00:51:28.35];Cindy Kern; Then, and then also understanding that my honors kids might, whatever you want to call them, but they are tracked my my honors kids are going to have this by October my
[00:51:40.08];Cindy Kern; My general kids, whatever you want to call them will have this by January and my special ed kids, my, my lowest level class will will have the spy June.
[00:51:51.93];Cindy Kern; Right will be like there's like you have like these are conversations that
[00:51:58.29];Cindy Kern; Are realistic.
[00:51:59.82];Cindy Kern; About what the classroom is right and who the students are and allowing the stupid teachers to think about who their students are and set meaningful meaningful goals for them to meet these these grade level expectations and be able to have these skills and abilities like
[00:52:20.91];Cindy Kern; You like those are those are
[00:52:24.84];Cindy Kern; That's us taking care of the teachers.
[00:52:26.85];TJ McKenna; Like well
[00:52:28.71];Cindy Kern; With them.
[00:52:29.61];TJ McKenna; Especially what we know with what happens to teachers during these like systemic reforms that like they're they're professionals.
[00:52:37.50];TJ McKenna; They're doing great work. And then all of a sudden, some they the collective they say, Actually, we figured it out. You should change everything and do it this way.
[00:52:47.01];TJ McKenna; And so, you know, that does rock.
[00:52:49.53];TJ McKenna; A lot of the foundations of teachers when they're thinking about, like, Wait, I've been doing all this other stuff like that bad, my bad.
[00:52:57.18];TJ McKenna; And so the. The other thing is we're in this. We're talking a lot about scale like NGS X initially with the the hybrid model was about scale like how do we get
[00:53:09.66];TJ McKenna; How do we get facilitators to, like, you know, it's not a fidelity of implementation thing but it kind of is.
[00:53:15.45];TJ McKenna; Like, how, how do we make the videos that are the things that might be too hard for them to be able to say, you know, the whoever
[00:53:23.04];TJ McKenna; Takes up facilitation. On that day, and then how do we allow for that. What we also know about being responsive to individual teachers needs in the moment.
[00:53:33.75];TJ McKenna; And so I wonder like, it seemed like you focus on two cohorts and project sing. And so what was your vision in terms of scale in your area for, like, this is a this is a project meant for thinking about scale but you seem to focus on
[00:53:50.76];TJ McKenna; Two cohorts that I know for a fact are still, you know, the they're still your loudest singers. They're, they're out and about and still really focused and they come to everything.
[00:54:02.61];TJ McKenna; And so, like, did you when you're thinking about Project saying, Where was it like this project and then we'll see, or did you have a long longer term vision of, like, I want to create something and then these people are going to be my advocates.
[00:54:15.63];Cindy Kern; Well,
[00:54:16.38];Margaret Foster; To be sorry quick clarification question. Um, so
[00:54:21.27];Margaret Foster; There, there is a year one cohort. And then those same participants came back for your to curriculum development, but there was also a new cohort, who are starting your that okay, sorry.
[00:54:32.58];Cindy Kern; Go. We actually had we actually had a third year with Project sing that didn't like I didn't get it funded
[00:54:40.83];Cindy Kern; So we didn't do NGS x
[00:54:43.47];Cindy Kern; We did Cohort two year to Cohort one year three
[00:54:51.21];unclear;Hmm.
[00:54:53.22];Cindy Kern; So,
[00:54:54.75];Margaret Foster; conferences where everybody would come back and be like, Look, what I'm doing, like,
[00:54:58.65];Margaret Foster; Yeah. Gotcha.
[00:55:00.48];unclear;Yeah.
[00:55:02.19];Cindy Kern; I will tell you, TJ. I'm like a lousy person when it comes to I'm a squirrel. Right. Like, am I in the moment person and project sing came to me as a mechanism to engage teachers.
[00:55:22.62];Cindy Kern; I you if you looked at my planning for Project sing this so frickin detail oriented. And then, of course, as all the plans do it went in a different direction. So when this all started it was, how can I help teachers in this transition. And then as we move forward. And as we
[00:55:45.57];Cindy Kern; As we worked to develop the skills and abilities of these teachers in the classroom.
[00:55:54.36];Cindy Kern; The Community became the most important thing to me.
[00:55:59.97];Cindy Kern; The community of of educators who were at many levels becoming
[00:56:08.79];Cindy Kern; A unit that held the same belief systems and shared its community of practice, but the same resources, the same constructs are concepts of what it means to engage learners and to teach
[00:56:23.22];Cindy Kern; To teach
[00:56:25.89];Cindy Kern; The Community became very important to me, NGOs, X continue to support that and grew. Our, our cohort from Cohort one to Cohort two
[00:56:38.70];Cindy Kern; And then I really went to. I really went in a didn't ever expect us because I've been a professional developer for 27 years and 20 now. Not that long.
[00:56:53.67];Cindy Kern; 25 years and so I never really thought that the unit that would be the most important thing because content and peace and K have always been so important to me.
[00:57:07.68];Cindy Kern; That the community would be the most important thing because if we care for the teachers and we care about their experiences and we can support them with
[00:57:19.95];Cindy Kern; An understanding of what teaching and learning. Miss and strategies are
[00:57:24.60];Cindy Kern; And we can do it in a caring
[00:57:28.17];Cindy Kern; Critical environment, then we can do amazing things.
[00:57:34.74];Cindy Kern; So my shift TJ, to be honest with you. It happened as I watched teachers go through a tremendous amount of struggle and tremendous amount of low like low support from the states and their districts
[00:57:53.13];Cindy Kern; A love and a desire to
[00:57:57.81];Cindy Kern; A lot of it had to grow in a lot of them, but a love and a desire for the students over anything else.
[00:58:05.13];Cindy Kern; And that that
[00:58:08.49];Cindy Kern; Knowing that they needed support in those areas that became what is actually the most important thing to me is that community of learners. So the community of educators
[00:58:21.00];Cindy Kern; That community so
[00:58:23.28];Cindy Kern; Can I say I was looking for to be something bigger.
[00:58:27.60];Cindy Kern; I had expectations walking out with my doctorate, and I had a model in which I wanted to follow through on through on in the first five years.
[00:58:38.55];Cindy Kern; And I probably did the fatal flaw in in what it means to be in higher ed, which is I went from where all my training is at and where my where my
[00:58:50.67];Cindy Kern; Trajectory was to know this is what feels like needs to happen and this is what feels right and
[00:58:58.92];Cindy Kern; I'm going to move in this direction, so now i i just focus on that group of any group any teacher. We meet every Wednesday night still every Wednesday night, since Cove, it happened, we were
[00:59:11.82];Cindy Kern; In a webinar. We have anywhere from 12 to 35 teachers that come in and
[00:59:16.89];Cindy Kern; We think about, we think about what it means to
[00:59:22.65];Cindy Kern; engage students and learning at home in science and we tried to negotiate, you know, 20 different school district policies and
[00:59:32.37];Cindy Kern; Zero help from the state and they have a safe space where they know people are like minded and they're not going to bitch and complain, they're gonna they're going to think about what they can do for kids.
[00:59:43.71];TJ McKenna; So awesome.
[00:59:45.42];TJ McKenna; Yeah, I've got an interview with the learning policy and Institute, so I gotta jump off right, Cindy. Thanks for the invite. On Wednesday nights.
[00:59:53.94];Cindy Kern; Yeah.
[00:59:56.07];Cindy Kern; You get it right.
[00:59:56.94];Cindy Kern; You're on our list.
[00:59:58.29];TJ McKenna; I don't think I am on the list.
[01:00:00.78];Cindy Kern; You have to be on the list. All right. Well, I'm
[01:00:04.47];TJ McKenna; Better whenever there's the
[01:00:07.23];TJ McKenna; unconference I get it from Todd and his peeps.
[01:00:10.62];Cindy Kern; How are you on my list I I'm adding new to it, right now I'm literally typing.
[01:00:20.58];Margaret Foster; So,
[01:00:22.05];Cindy Kern; I will tell you, it has digress to a lot of drinking lately, but it's still good. It's still
[01:00:26.43];TJ McKenna; That we all have to survive.
[01:00:28.98];TJ McKenna; Yeah. All right.
[01:00:30.30];Cindy Kern; TJ.
[01:00:31.17];Margaret Foster; You. Well, thank you so much.
[01:00:33.60];Cindy Kern; I didn't understand what this was about
[01:00:37.71];Margaret Foster; Yeah me neither. I'm good.
[01:00:40.68];Cindy Kern; I didn't understand like i thought that i didn't i thought
[01:00:46.17];Cindy Kern; I thought you were interviewing TJ and I about
