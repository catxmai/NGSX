[00:01:30.30];Margaret Foster; Good morning. How's it going,
[00:01:32.04];TJ McKenna; Hello, not bad but you
[00:01:35.46];Margaret Foster; Can get in there doing my best.
[00:01:38.28];TJ McKenna; We can do
[00:01:39.42];unclear;Yeah.
[00:01:44.25];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:01:45.03];TJ McKenna; I thought the best quote that I
[00:01:48.66];TJ McKenna; reshare it on Instagram.
[00:01:50.76];unclear;He
[00:01:52.32];TJ McKenna; Says this idea of slowly reopening has the feel of letting my kindergarteners choose their own partners, there'll be very clear directions given beforehand, lots of examples, but pretty soon we're all going to come sit back down on the carpet.
[00:02:09.99];Margaret Foster; I saw another one back closer to the beginning of everything, where somebody was like, uh, I feel like I'm back in kindergarten and we're losing recess, because not everybody can like stay inside and sit down.
[00:02:24.06];unclear;Yes.
[00:02:26.04];TJ McKenna; Totally
[00:02:27.78];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:02:29.76];Margaret Foster; So,
[00:02:31.89];Margaret Foster; How is your other work going and stuff.
[00:02:36.00];TJ McKenna; It's pretty crazy. It's
[00:02:37.59];TJ McKenna; It feels weird that grades are and and submitted and now I have more work.
[00:02:42.33];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:02:43.05];TJ McKenna; We're coming from
[00:02:44.52];TJ McKenna; Yeah.
[00:02:45.93];TJ McKenna; That doesn't say no to it.
[00:02:49.62];Margaret Foster; Yeah, an important no
[00:02:51.78];TJ McKenna; Yeah, I don't have that one yet.
[00:02:54.36];Margaret Foster; Working on it. But thank you for making time to do this today. Yeah.
[00:03:00.18];TJ McKenna; Yeah, that would be fun.
[00:03:05.49];TJ McKenna; I showed you my newest addition.
[00:03:08.55];Margaret Foster; Now,
[00:03:09.90];TJ McKenna; So my wife had bought me this one.
[00:03:16.65];TJ McKenna; And
[00:03:17.28];TJ McKenna; Like people can see it.
[00:03:19.08];Margaret Foster; Huh.
[00:03:20.04];Margaret Foster; I, Cindy. Hello.
[00:03:21.81];Cindy Kern; How are you guys
[00:03:22.95];TJ McKenna; Just sharing my newest addition with Maggie.
[00:03:25.80];TJ McKenna; On my dead stuff wall.
[00:03:27.39];TJ McKenna; And so I needed a new addition to my wife bought me this one.
[00:03:32.85];Cindy Kern; Okay, nice.
[00:03:34.11];TJ McKenna; Nice. I didn't realize
[00:03:35.82];TJ McKenna; Until director at BU said TJ, my favorite. I think is the one that says I don't give a rat's ass and like you can see that from here.
[00:03:44.97];TJ McKenna; Was I replaced it with this. It's a row. Dear from England. And so this is David really
[00:03:51.66];Cindy Kern; Nice.
[00:03:53.28];Margaret Foster; I like that. Okay.
[00:03:54.81];TJ McKenna; Pretty excited about it.
[00:03:57.15];Cindy Kern; I would have left the rat's ass one up.
[00:04:00.30];TJ McKenna; I just was meeting with so many students and her as the director. It's like student services. I was like, I think she's telling me to take that down.
[00:04:09.54];TJ McKenna; That's a nice subtle way. I like that one. TJ. Okay.
[00:04:16.98];unclear;That's hilarious.
[00:04:19.56];Margaret Foster; Oh dear. Yeah.
[00:04:21.66];Cindy Kern; I see you have quite the collage behind you, as well.
[00:04:25.47];Margaret Foster; I do. Um, it's all the stuff from the internet. I printed out before the internet became a wasteland, you know,
[00:04:36.72];Margaret Foster; Yeah, like back when artists sites were anywhere except Instagram.
[00:04:41.07];Cindy Kern; Stuff like that. Okay. Okay.
[00:04:43.80];Cindy Kern; Very nice, very nice.
[00:04:45.84];Margaret Foster; Yeah, just the stuff. Yeah, you can check
[00:04:50.94];Cindy Kern; I
[00:04:51.63];TJ McKenna; Haven't I thought you'd have a chicken on each shoulder
[00:04:54.84];Cindy Kern; Well actually the reason I'm running late is
[00:04:58.20];Cindy Kern; Without loose so my husband and I were were convincing her to head back to the enclosure and the coop so
[00:05:07.74];Cindy Kern; Yeah.
[00:05:09.72];Cindy Kern; They're, they're, they're a wily little group for being two months, not even I guess just two weeks, two months old yesterday, so uh yeah they're keeping it real, but keep it real.
[00:05:21.12];TJ McKenna; There definitely, yeah.
[00:05:22.71];TJ McKenna; The closer you get to raising them, the more you're like these are tiny dinosaurs that just wanted
[00:05:27.36];TJ McKenna; Yeah, everything
[00:05:29.28];Cindy Kern; Yeah, we, you know, this is our. This is what this is our fourth flock. And I guess five years. No, I guess. Our, our third flock and five years because our my son's junior and senior year. We didn't do we didn't raise babies. Just because his sports schedule was too insane.
[00:05:51.93];Cindy Kern; So,
[00:05:53.76];Cindy Kern; This we have 16 because usually about 25% them into being roosters and we have to we have to find them a home that's not in North Haven, because we're not allowed to have roosters in North Haven.
[00:06:08.46];Cindy Kern; So we only appear to have one rooster and he is so dinosaur so
[00:06:14.67];Cindy Kern; In everything that he does, it's, it's so much
[00:06:18.90];Cindy Kern; He's a jerk and so much fun at the same time. So, yeah.
[00:06:23.91];Cindy Kern; You're crazy.
[00:06:24.51];TJ McKenna; Sweet mouth when they find a mouse and just fight over it rip it to shreds.
[00:06:29.61];Cindy Kern; Yeah, I'd like the Chipmunk that goes in and out, out of the enclosure.
[00:06:34.50];Cindy Kern; It's funny to watch and go like
[00:06:35.61];unclear;This
[00:06:37.44];Cindy Kern; Like a chipmunk or the chickens go
[00:06:39.84];Cindy Kern; And they eyeball them with one I
[00:06:42.21];Cindy Kern; Think. Oh, he's out
[00:06:47.10];TJ McKenna; Against
[00:06:47.61];Cindy Kern; The dinosaurs. Yep. Yep.
[00:06:51.00];Cindy Kern; Oh man way they run
[00:06:58.20];Margaret Foster; Just so I could have chickens, especially
[00:07:00.54];Margaret Foster; Is, but I do want a cutter and make sure that we spend lots of time on on this so that we can all get back to our baby dinosaurs imaginary
[00:07:13.98];TJ McKenna; Maggie, nice.
[00:07:16.80];Cindy Kern; To control TJ my
[00:07:19.65];Cindy Kern; Southern a while.
[00:07:21.72];Margaret Foster; Before that, like, I would love for this to be a nice conversation like
[00:07:25.65];Margaret Foster; We're, we're writing this paper with gene that we've talked about before. Um, and the, what are the gaps so we kind of notice was or at least personally I don't know a lot about new terrain.
[00:07:37.32];Margaret Foster; Or like how that informed projects saying or what effect that had on the rest of the ecosystem of Connecticut education.
[00:07:45.75];Margaret Foster; And so the purpose of this meeting is kind of both to have a fun conversation about baby chicken dinosaurs, but also to just kind of try to fill that gap in a little bit.
[00:07:58.53];Margaret Foster; And thank you both so much again for taking the time out of your busy schedules to do this right now because I know things are crazy.
[00:08:07.41];Margaret Foster; So yeah, and I'd love to kind of start off just like what
[00:08:13.02];Margaret Foster; Why did you apply to new terrain like what brought you to that experience where you like submitted your application. What was your vision for you were like, I'm going to this out of this professional development experience. What did that look like for you.
[00:08:28.98];Cindy Kern; Oh for TJ.
[00:08:32.61];TJ McKenna; So, mine was kind of weird. I was being asked to do inquiry training and tried to get into new terrain via pen crooner and gene said no we don't need informal science educators in this. This is for
[00:08:49.71];TJ McKenna; IT folks and this is for formal classroom teachers. And so I ended up going through Holly Carrick who I was, the scientist in residence at the stem Academy and Windham and Holly said any project that gene Moon is associated with is going to be an awesome project.
[00:09:09.75];TJ McKenna; And so I joined as a elementary wind up teacher which gene and Sarah and Brian all still laugh about, to this day, because I think I still have my thing here that says
[00:09:21.12];TJ McKenna; Elementary Wyndham teacher and I was so nervous that somebody's going to call me out and be like, I'm actually the principal there and you don't work there and get out, get out of here.
[00:09:32.31];Cindy Kern; Yeah, I can't imagine any nervous about anything.
[00:09:40.80];Margaret Foster; Okay. Oh, sorry.
[00:09:41.82];Cindy Kern; Oh my mind was, I literally had just moved to Connecticut from Las Vegas and I had been here for
[00:09:52.20];Cindy Kern; Oh,
[00:09:54.15];Cindy Kern; I think it was new terrain 2013 2014 or was it 2014 2015 and 20 1314 right
[00:10:05.79];Margaret Foster; I'm
[00:10:05.97];Cindy Kern; Pretty sure it was 20 1314
[00:10:08.43];Cindy Kern; Because I I had
[00:10:12.72];Cindy Kern; Actually, I think it's 20 1415 I had just been here and I was in my first year and I think it was Bonnie Mauer I want to say Bonnie Mauer was the one that reached out to me and said,
[00:10:25.98];Cindy Kern; We want to get all i cheese involved in this, you know, please, please find a blank number of teachers to work with invite them to come along. I couldn't even find my house without Google Maps, let alone. Could I say that I knew any teachers.
[00:10:47.76];Cindy Kern; In the classroom I had only started to get to know the pre service teachers at that time.
[00:10:54.27];Cindy Kern; I reached out to a colleague within my school and said, Can you help me out. I would like to do this, but I need three or five teachers to do this with me.
[00:11:07.53];Cindy Kern; She rounded up teachers for me and then
[00:11:14.79];Cindy Kern; Yeah, that's, that's how it happened. It wasn't, it was my my head was spinning way too much in that first year to say that I was actively looking for
[00:11:24.63];Cindy Kern; I was actually actively looking for anything. It came to me, which I'm extremely grateful that it had come to me.
[00:11:33.03];TJ McKenna; And where you at, where you have you ever seen the haven that I got the time
[00:11:38.46];Cindy Kern; I was, I was a tenured professor at UNH at the time. So I had taken over for
[00:11:51.09];Cindy Kern; Why am I all of a sudden blanking on her name.
[00:11:54.78];Cindy Kern; She worked with the IT group for a long time, she went back to the classroom. She was at set Southern Kathy.
[00:12:02.37];TJ McKenna; Oh, I know you're talking about
[00:12:04.32];Cindy Kern; Kathy.
[00:12:05.25];TJ McKenna; Who did the she did triathlons
[00:12:07.92];Cindy Kern; Yes, she did try
[00:12:09.33];Cindy Kern; Yes, that's
[00:12:10.74];TJ McKenna; My mind it's Cathy triathlons
[00:12:12.72];Cindy Kern; Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right. So,
[00:12:20.85];Margaret Foster; Cindy, are you still there.
[00:12:28.92];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:12:36.96];TJ McKenna; Let's give it a second. So either come back or drop out.
[00:12:39.90];unclear;Yeah.
[00:12:45.24];Margaret Foster; I like the details. Remember about people cap new does triathlons
[00:12:49.74];TJ McKenna; That's how you. That's how you do it. So you remember names.
[00:12:52.56];unclear;Yeah.
[00:12:54.66];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:12:55.68];TJ McKenna; We do with my pre service crew when there's a huge group. We found one of the better things to do is to do
[00:13:04.59];TJ McKenna; You know, everybody does, you know, say your name and say something fun. You're doing this summer, say, and like people come up with the most random stuff and it's sometimes hard like I'm gonna go to the beach.
[00:13:15.75];TJ McKenna; Like, that doesn't stick. And so we started doing. They say your name, you know, whatever program you're in elementary ed or whatever special ed and then something super, super boring about you.
[00:13:30.66];TJ McKenna; And they're so good. They're so good I
[00:13:36.00];TJ McKenna; Just like you almost get a little glimpse into somebody's personality like somebody will say, like, and I'm I'm five foot one
[00:13:46.50];TJ McKenna; Or somebody will say like my eye color is gray or I really, really like having three pillows on my bed.
[00:13:57.15];TJ McKenna; And they like. They like is that little glimpse into like what
[00:14:01.53];TJ McKenna; What you know something about you but also what you think is boring about you.
[00:14:06.15];TJ McKenna; And a lot of times
[00:14:07.98];TJ McKenna; As you go around people generally don't want to say the same thing.
[00:14:11.40];TJ McKenna; And so they start saying stuff that's like really, really good.
[00:14:14.88];TJ McKenna; Like, that's not boring and they say another thing that's not boring either like more and you're out one more hallway.
[00:14:22.98];TJ McKenna; becomes just a really fun conversation of, like, is this boring about me like
[00:14:29.31];Margaret Foster; That's a good icebreaker yeah
[00:14:32.31];Margaret Foster; Cuz sometimes it's harder to come up with things that are exciting you know depending on what kind of lifestyle, especially if you're like a student or about to be a teacher.
[00:14:40.74];Margaret Foster; Yes, like I do my homework like
[00:14:45.81];Margaret Foster; To say
[00:14:47.25];TJ McKenna; That it's like i think it's it's a good icebreaker and almost like a secret culture building
[00:14:52.65];TJ McKenna; Because you can see who laughs at what
[00:14:55.35];TJ McKenna; And who knows each other and you know if they, you know, I always try to go somewhere in the mix. So it's not like me going first or be going last
[00:15:03.66];Margaret Foster; Hmm.
[00:15:04.44];unclear;That's good.
[00:15:06.09];TJ McKenna; It is pretty ridiculous.
[00:15:07.80];Margaret Foster; All these great tips. I'm get a file that boy for the next seven have to read it. Nice.
[00:15:14.46];Margaret Foster; That's good. That's really good.
[00:15:19.62];Margaret Foster; Should I, you know, Cindy. Again, Jason, what is
[00:15:22.98];TJ McKenna; The link if she got into it.
[00:15:24.96];unclear;Yeah.
[00:15:26.58];TJ McKenna; Yeah.
[00:15:28.02];TJ McKenna; Just wonder of her internet. It's funny, I think she is
[00:15:32.88];TJ McKenna; I can't remember what she's out in the woods. Yeah. I wonder if he's got trickier internet
[00:15:40.32];Margaret Foster; Yeah.
[00:15:41.49];TJ McKenna; And you have this on just with both are now the password wasn't even I didn't ask me for the password.
[00:15:48.12];Margaret Foster; I think if you click the like personalized link.
[00:15:50.67];Margaret Foster; It'll last for a password. Maybe or maybe
[00:15:54.09];Margaret Foster; I'm doing it doesn't ask for a password or something.
[00:15:57.33];TJ McKenna; I just know with mine. I set the set the waiting room up so that if we're people try to join that I don't recognize I just kick them out.
[00:16:06.18];TJ McKenna; Yeah, but
[00:16:07.92];Margaret Foster; Twice haven't gotten there yet.
[00:16:12.42];Margaret Foster; Um,
[00:16:14.70];Margaret Foster; I might have lost track of what Cindy was thinking about at the end because I think it was a question that or a follow up question you asked, do you remember what it was.
[00:16:23.10];TJ McKenna; Yeah, she was just checking. I know that I remember her being at UNH before Cindy just text me. I'm trying to get back in. So let me send her the link
[00:16:40.41];TJ McKenna; She was at UNH at the time. And then I don't know if the
[00:16:48.21];TJ McKenna; And this is probably isn't helpful for what we need. I just sent her the zoom links should jump back in
[00:16:55.83];TJ McKenna; That somewhere in the nutrient project. She got this better gig at Quinnipiac to like be the director of the project.
[00:17:04.32];TJ McKenna; That's we don't really need to follow up on that.
[00:17:07.11];TJ McKenna; I think we can spend the majority of the time just unpacking the new train experience like the first couple days. What do you would you would you think
[00:17:19.08];TJ McKenna; I can leave that question once she jumps back in
[00:17:23.25];Margaret Foster; My transition was going to be, you know, so how did it light up with your expectations GJ obviously nobody calling you out for adopting elementary school teacher, though, that worked well for you.
[00:17:33.09];TJ McKenna; I wonder if we have the
[00:17:35.52];TJ McKenna; Same here.
[00:17:37.62];TJ McKenna; It's just cleaning stuff and found it.
[00:17:56.73];TJ McKenna; somebody's name badges.
[00:18:04.77];TJ McKenna; And way too many phones like I feel like I hide my privilege in this drawer.
[00:18:10.47];TJ McKenna; Had that phone. And this phone. And this one.
[00:18:13.98];Margaret Foster; I wish that there were an easier way to go about, like, I don't know. I also I have old computers which at this point.
[00:18:21.57];TJ McKenna; Or opposed to I'm here.
[00:18:23.55];Margaret Foster; Yeah, like at this point, I am not even sure that I could get them to turn on to get all the files off of them.
[00:18:29.55];unclear;Well,
[00:18:31.14];Margaret Foster; Yeah. What am I going to do now, they just kind of collecting dust somewhere.
[00:18:34.83];TJ McKenna; Yeah, and like random tablets, like everyone tries to my teacher likes computer stuff. Let's give him this
[00:18:40.65];TJ McKenna; And so I have like
[00:18:42.00];TJ McKenna; Two candles likes you know an old iPad that barely works.
[00:18:46.14];TJ McKenna; It's like I wish there was a way to, you know, they're full of rare earth metals, be nice to
[00:18:53.97];TJ McKenna; Screen off for us the screen or something.
[00:18:56.79];Margaret Foster; Yeah yeah yeah I think about that all the time like lack of sustainability and, like, how do you recycle stuff. I don't know.
[00:19:05.67];TJ McKenna; I wish I did.
[00:19:08.31];TJ McKenna; Was I just reading about I went down a climate change rabbit hole and the
[00:19:13.77];TJ McKenna; That how I think it was China bought this area in Mexico that had all these rare earth.
[00:19:19.29];TJ McKenna; Materials and Mexico didn't know about it at all. Didn't care at all. And so, China, like came in and was like harvesting all this, I forget what it was, but something that you need to make cell phones and the cartel found out that, like, what are these Chinese people doing here.
[00:19:37.29];TJ McKenna; And I bet they're getting something that we could get. And so they like started murdering people and took it over and then didn't know what to do, like, sorry. Now, how do we get the stuff out of it.
[00:19:51.18];TJ McKenna; Was like this whole messy, like I felt like I was reading this art know very well that you'd love it if I could find it the way that they like were able to unpack this story and tell the story.
[00:20:03.30];TJ McKenna; But
[00:20:04.08];TJ McKenna; I felt like I was reading this journal article or, you know, online article that was like a movie like
[00:20:11.07];TJ McKenna; Rich and like the turns and the well written.
[00:20:15.54];Margaret Foster; Yeah, sometimes I forget that we really only unique real life you know it is as good as fiction.
[00:20:22.11];TJ McKenna; Yes.
[00:20:23.34];Margaret Foster; That's crazy. Was this recent or was it several years ago, I think.
[00:20:26.79];TJ McKenna; It was within like the last
[00:20:28.35];unclear;Five years
[00:20:31.35];TJ McKenna; And
[00:20:33.54];TJ McKenna; How I got on and we're doing the climate pathway with the big low folks. And I'm assuming it's that
[00:20:40.74];TJ McKenna; She just said my Wi Fi is dead in my service service and my phone is body resetting my router.
[00:20:48.24];TJ McKenna; Always happens when you're in the middle of something
[00:20:51.45];Margaret Foster; Yeah, so it's likely Sunday we
[00:20:55.29];Margaret Foster; I ended up there was a comedy of errors. So it took like
[00:21:00.36];Margaret Foster; Yeah, like half an hour. Just, just get the Wi Fi and everything working and we ended up like the sound wasn't working. So I just called her and put it on speakerphone see each other. And yeah, it was a mess.
[00:21:13.95];TJ McKenna; I didn't look at the time, or we heard she texted me so I should have that time.
[00:21:20.52];TJ McKenna; So 1015
[00:21:23.43];TJ McKenna; And then whenever she comes back on. We'll just mark for
[00:21:26.73];TJ McKenna; Me not to transcribe
[00:21:28.77];Margaret Foster; Right, yeah.
