[00:00:21.42];Margaret Foster; make major changes or whatever additions need to happen. Just make sure it can happen within the, the scope of a day. So kind of getting all that
[00:00:32.52];Margaret Foster; Back into order for myself as well as to start making it so everybody's questions, concerns, comments, hopefully are getting addressed, and then we can hopefully next week, go through
[00:00:45.63];Margaret Foster; Unit one and say this is at least where the most recent working draft that we all probably have some agreement on but need to go through and revise it should be pretty much ready then and then the segue into unit.
[00:01:00.57];Margaret Foster; To
[00:01:02.58];Margaret Foster; Which is going to be a little bit. I think it was great to talk with Nick, but then also thinking about where that bigger
[00:01:09.00];Margaret Foster; Question, but that bigger conversation around what's the difference between data.
[00:01:12.75];Margaret Foster; Big data and data and where that would fit in, because that's kind of like an anchor for I think unit to or a driving force, maybe not anchor with an appropriate way to think about it, but that's kind of where I'm at.
[00:01:24.81];Margaret Foster; And trying to
[00:01:27.27];Margaret Foster; Kick this there a draft or will there be a draft this in a Google Doc in our folder that that we can check on in the coming week
[00:01:36.84];Margaret Foster; Yeah, there will be. I'm going to start to like I said, I'm kind of organizing it and getting it because I think
[00:01:41.70];Margaret Foster; As TJ to has started develop some of these overview documents, I kind of want to have those in a place that leads to the storyboard documents. So things are kind of either in one place or
[00:01:52.92];Margaret Foster; organizes the bed. Yes. What I'm going to start to do because we have a lot of stuff and a lot of different places. And I just want to make sure that
[00:02:03.54];Margaret Foster; Well, so I can focus on it, but so that everyone else can as well. So just kind of get some of that out of the way.
[00:02:10.35];Margaret Foster; And then I think talking with TJ to I think last the end of last week just thinking about
[00:02:17.70];Margaret Foster; Continuing with that like overview document as well. Like what's like a two, paragraph summary of unit one, for example, so something that we can all say
[00:02:26.82];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I'm on board with that and then that's kind of our check to make sure unit one makes sense and segues into unit two and that if we have these
[00:02:36.27];Margaret Foster; Are larger workshop goals and the NGS X principles and like the touch. We have a lot of different ways to start thinking about are we. Are we approaching
[00:02:47.10];Margaret Foster; meeting those goals or, you know, like the the the
[00:02:51.78];Margaret Foster; Design principles, just to kind of make sure that we all can and look at it in about an evaluative way but that makes sense. So we don't always have to dig into the storyboard or whatever it is. And then the only other thing I'm doing is
[00:03:06.81];Margaret Foster; Slowly taking out some of the really great conversations that we have, we've had that would belong in the facilitators matrix or something started to take some of those out because we've talked a lot about
[00:03:20.07];Margaret Foster; The prompts, or more specifically, like the, why are we doing this. So just to make sure, like, hey, we're not setting participants up for a dead end. Here's our thinking in this step. So just to start not not making it nice and pretty or anything, but just to start
[00:03:34.41];Margaret Foster; pulling some of those conversations we've had around some of the steps that will be great for facilitators to think about just starting to put it all into those places, some kind of organizational stuff and Wow, very, very important. I agree with you. We have a lot in our folder and
[00:03:56.34];Margaret Foster; It needs some organization.
[00:04:00.42];Margaret Foster; As you begin to think about a unit one and unit you guys going to unit to
[00:04:09.75];Margaret Foster; I'm assuming we are we are going to begin to do the integration of some of the ideas from the curriculum that Ben has developed and pulling those integrating those into various steps so that that is evolving.
[00:04:31.83];Margaret Foster; A lot, along with other sorts of activities or use of tools are learning about tools or modeling, whatever, whatever the other surround activities are going to be
[00:04:44.07];Margaret Foster; Is that that. Yeah, definitely. I think the first step is kind of organizing and making sure everything's in a in a nice place.
[00:04:52.29];Margaret Foster; And then that's definitely a part of that layering and to make sure that either. You know, I know. Ben's working on it a lot to make sure that there's those those nice connections between the curricular units and the pathway and that will also I think once
[00:05:09.48];Margaret Foster; Kind of have gone through everything and
[00:05:13.14];Margaret Foster; Start putting all these pieces into place that will help us identify where those were those really strong connections are, you know, for example, because I think thinking even about caps and unit one. Like where can we draw a connection to, you know, like thinking about
[00:05:28.89];Margaret Foster; The color ramping and math and everything and connect that to something in in Ben's unit and we didn't even put like a nice little placeholder in there and figure out how we're going to connect
[00:05:40.14];Margaret Foster; Those two just seems like that kind of moving one forward to move the other one forward to move one forward to move the other ones, or is it is that it's sort of bringing it all along.
[00:05:54.93];Margaret Foster; Together.
[00:05:56.82];Margaret Foster; Rather than holding off the curriculum till the end. We talked about that.
[00:06:02.25];Margaret Foster; several sessions ago yeah and then
[00:06:07.26];Margaret Foster; Where are you
[00:06:09.27];Margaret Foster; And what, what, how can we be helpful. All right. Um, I feel like I'm moving from this place where I've been thinking big picture about the curriculum and it has gotten sprawling and it's time to start figuring out how it could be
[00:06:24.21];Margaret Foster; Tightened up because it would just take a really long time to engage in a curriculum that has everything that I've put in there in it and so
[00:06:36.72];Margaret Foster; It would be really valuable for me to have feedback from you all about
[00:06:43.68];Margaret Foster; Where
[00:06:45.96];Margaret Foster; I can take this kind of winding road and cut a couple of switchbacks. If you know what i that metaphor makes any sense. I'm a like I feel just about everything that's in there is something that I've, I've tested at some point in some of my
[00:07:05.07];Margaret Foster; Some of my high school classes but
[00:07:10.77];Margaret Foster; It would take, you know, I would take a half a semester to do this unit on climate as it's written, which is good. That's like, you know, that was my partly my intention is to, like, just put it all out there and then
[00:07:22.71];Margaret Foster; Call the good stuff. But, um, that's one and that that's actually my biggest concern right now is like, wow, it all seems to fit so nicely. What do I pull out without
[00:07:36.00];Margaret Foster; Without losing coherence for students, etc. And that probably isn't something that we can do by looking at it together. Right now it's just a request for folks to. I would love for another couple sets of eyes to take a look at where it is now and
[00:07:57.90];Margaret Foster; And come back and just let me know thoughts on that I'll be that's I imagine what the next set of
[00:08:06.60];Margaret Foster; Tasks for me is going to be. And then after that's done. Um, I think that the next piece is taking whatever the that pare down curriculum is as a storyline and start building out the materials that go with each experience so that
[00:08:28.23];Margaret Foster; You know, I haven't put in anything in the curriculum like here's where I have a discussion. Well, you know, here's where I use
[00:08:35.64];Margaret Foster; A here's where I am using gallery walks, here's where I'm engaging people in small group work or providing readings or anything like that. So,
[00:08:48.60];Margaret Foster; Um, so I think that's that's a step that comes after the kind of editing on the larger scale, so that I don't end up doing that for every piece of the curriculum, much of which may not end up in the final product.
[00:09:07.08];Margaret Foster; An important question for me benefit could sneak in here is, are there.
[00:09:13.47];Margaret Foster; I think it's important for us to kind of see this through your eyes as as the, the writer, the creator and are there. Have you been able to identify areas in the curriculum.
[00:09:30.21];Margaret Foster; Depths in the curriculum that are kind of non negotiable. I mean, these seem like really strong anchor points.
[00:09:39.81];Margaret Foster; And from which you are building forts a series of experiences or understandings. So I think it's just good for us to know a little bit more about your design thinking and
[00:09:58.62];Margaret Foster; Yeah what those anchor anchor points or
[00:10:02.79];Margaret Foster; What I was wondering too if the
[00:10:05.88];Margaret Foster; Like all of the if all of the things that elements that are in the curriculum are are useful and things that you've tried and you feel like are important.
[00:10:14.94];Margaret Foster; Maybe in to kind of step back from the open side model and the next gen storylines, like all that craziness, like those are so big and that they overwhelm teachers. I wonder if we do like
[00:10:28.86];Margaret Foster; These three almost would Jane what you're just saying these three things are coming into focus as like these are key moments in the trajectory of the entire unit and maybe you only do the, you know, this is how I start the you know gallery walks, all of those elements, you know, the
[00:10:50.67];Margaret Foster; Discussion planning tool like all maybe it's like full detail on these three key parts and the rest of it can be more skeleton.
[00:11:01.20];Margaret Foster; And so you're not, you know, you're not cutting. Good stuff. But you're just zooming in on these different pieces because if we think about that last unit. I think we're calling a unit for
[00:11:12.51];Margaret Foster; Somebody might take something that, you know, it's still not fully built out and build it out in a different direction. And so maybe taking good you know something with good bones and adding their flavor to it.
[00:11:27.54];Margaret Foster; And I think that would be that'd be very useful for a lot of people because because climate change is so overwhelming of a topic or climate, you know, with large
[00:11:38.79];Margaret Foster; Yeah. Well, and that's an interesting thought like I
[00:11:44.82];Margaret Foster; I kept imagining like having a package that wouldn't
[00:11:49.44];Margaret Foster; I don't know. I kept imagining trying to pair this down to like two or three weeks of like period length classes and
[00:12:00.54];Margaret Foster; I don't know that it doesn't seem to me like
[00:12:03.96];Margaret Foster; This doesn't seem possible that you can get kids to a deep understanding of of
[00:12:10.74];Margaret Foster; All of climate change in that period of time. It's just so enormous like I feel like
[00:12:16.59];Margaret Foster; That
[00:12:18.93];Margaret Foster; Maybe just showing the whole trajectory
[00:12:24.12];Margaret Foster; That would take someone all the way there. And then just yeah I don't know what other people think about what to do, just said.
[00:12:31.65];Margaret Foster; Level more thought. So, based on what you just said. The, the ambitious science teaching crew would 100%
[00:12:39.45];Margaret Foster; Be on board with the two week like that's that's you know what their research has told them. That's what they said you know unit should be about two to three weeks. And that's it.
[00:12:49.89];Margaret Foster; And but I also have been I was looking more at some grant funding around this. I don't know.
[00:12:56.58];Margaret Foster; I don't know what I'm doing is a genius, probably more up your alley, but I'm just looking to see what out what is out there for, you know, new educational grants.
[00:13:05.40];Margaret Foster; And was wondering that you know kind of with achieve and CSS falling apart. And it all going
[00:13:14.07];Margaret Foster; To kick this work up. Yeah, it's all gone. The West and West Ed has so much money and. And so, you know, we definitely don't want another person.
[00:13:22.68];Margaret Foster; In the you know saying we're going to do this and do this and cut that but I almost want to just have a conversation with the, I think it's three women that are the new
[00:13:34.23];Margaret Foster; Directors of the end, you know, the new NGOs s and they're just from their social media stuff they're figuring out like they're not posting polished clean things and so
[00:13:47.16];Margaret Foster; I wonder if this might be something that they would put some generous funding behind because it's such a big project. And if that's something you know we're even interested in having a conversation about or, you know, eventually partnering with
[00:14:06.24];Margaret Foster; With a group like that.
[00:14:10.20];Margaret Foster; I said once once once we have I think there are a lot of spin off points. Once, once we have this
[00:14:20.76];Margaret Foster; Halfway assembled and and i would have no problem with partnering with this. The western I've been looking at a couple of other foundations with that very idea in mind at the MGM foundation is one
[00:14:38.46];Margaret Foster; So, but until we we kind of get some size of a pathway determined here, but people get a flavor or, as you said, TJ, I always like that expression, we've laid down some really strong bones.
[00:14:58.68];Margaret Foster; And one can build off of those, you know, to make a longer arm or a shorter leg or whatever. But we need to get the whole but it's been a manageable whole to demonstrate
[00:15:16.83];Margaret Foster; The what we what we're capable of doing and and then the partners will come to us.
[00:15:24.18];Margaret Foster; Or we can go to them but ever
[00:15:27.33];Margaret Foster; So,
[00:15:29.46];Margaret Foster; I think it
[00:15:31.59];Margaret Foster; I don't know what to say about the two or three week thing.
[00:15:35.46];Margaret Foster; I think this is an awfully complex topic.
[00:15:40.11];Margaret Foster; I guess I was thinking more like six now. Yeah, I was just going to jump in on that point as well because I think
[00:15:47.91];Margaret Foster; And I don't remember. It's been a little while that I reviewed the A ST book as well, and they're kind of approach. I think the one thing is that they use fewer core ideas or fewer science concepts to achieve that to three week time period. And I think Ben's unit would be
[00:16:06.42];Margaret Foster; Multiple of those two or three week kind of units. So I, you know, like it's it's hard to think about a way to because it is short changing it, so maybe there is a little bit of a of a preface to it that you know these are are several you know either units are many units all all purposefully
[00:16:28.17];Margaret Foster; Used if you're going to connect them and have enough time to cover all of it. And then you'll get these understandings. If you do something in two, three weeks, and you want to focus on the mechanisms.
[00:16:39.45];Margaret Foster; Then you know this part, you know you focus on this sub unit this sub unit or that sub unit and that would also help us maybe think about
[00:16:49.74];Margaret Foster; I know I think KJ before mentioned like that kind of spider web. And so if there's like a central starting place.
[00:16:56.85];Margaret Foster; Which could be a shorter you know couple week unit. And then these other you know webs are pieces that go from, I don't know. It's all web these other lines are these other units or many units that you can then go do which bring you in all these different
[00:17:15.57];Margaret Foster; Ways of thinking, which makes it super hard to write
[00:17:18.96];Margaret Foster; A unit because if you're been thinking it's going to cover all of these things, then all of those ideas are being percolated or bounced around in the beginning and questions are coming up around that. So it's, it leads to a challenge. And I also emailed everybody
[00:17:37.35];Margaret Foster; University of Washington someone there came out with this like 30 page document have a ton of links to a ton of different climate based
[00:17:48.30];Margaret Foster; Units things to do with students activities simulations and I just shared it with everyone. Because then when you were like,
[00:17:56.49];Margaret Foster; You know, maybe there's something in there. You can just grab really quickly for like a simulation or something that fits with what you're doing, not to add more stuff to you. It's super, super
[00:18:06.18];Margaret Foster; Super long the table of contents is like eight pages and the rest of it is just linked, but it seems like it might be something that could come in handy. But
[00:18:17.61];Margaret Foster; Sounds like a great danger.
[00:18:20.31];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I think it is. And so it's pretty recent as well. So I didn't poke around in it too much because I would have got lost in there for hours.
[00:18:29.22];Margaret Foster; But it seems like it could be something that has some use and it also might help us think about how other people are hopefully coming up with the same challenge. It's way too complex to do in
[00:18:42.30];Margaret Foster; A few amount of weeks, so maybe that like some modular ideas will kind of come from that as well.
[00:18:50.07];Margaret Foster; Just as as as an aside,
[00:18:52.98];Margaret Foster; The State of Washington has a fairly large size.
[00:19:00.93];Margaret Foster; Amount of money.
[00:19:03.12];Margaret Foster; To give to school districts to begin climate science, science, especially at the high school level. So that makes sense to me that people would be up there, you know, sort of,
[00:19:18.24];Margaret Foster; Doing these these aggregations as not really a deep, deep dive, but just at the resource level, but I think we're going for the coherence here.
[00:19:31.44];Margaret Foster; And that makes a big big difference.
[00:19:38.82];Margaret Foster; I think, I think the point then is
[00:19:45.33];Margaret Foster; To help you and the project come up with
[00:19:52.77];Margaret Foster; Whether it's a module or our traditional or series of modules that reflect the curriculum or ways in which that curriculum comes into the pathway in very important in significant ways in terms of moving this construction of understandings around oceans climate in big data.
[00:20:20.91];Margaret Foster; But yet, it doesn't overwhelm the teacher and and maybe there are, you know, I guess the spider.
[00:20:29.82];Margaret Foster; Illustration is as good as any there's sort of a core piece of ideas and constructs that have to be there. And then there are these extensions that would give kids a deeper dive into some of those ideas, but that can be at the choice of the teacher.
[00:20:50.10];Margaret Foster; Puts the bones are in that center part. But I think the hard thing is determining what our bones and what are extensions and it's hard.
[00:21:00.39];Margaret Foster; Right well on that, um, the, the slides that I sent it out to everybody. Last week, right. We're WITH THAT. THAT WAS ONE LENS throws it through which I was trying to think about that very problem because
[00:21:18.48];Margaret Foster; Each of those each of those Ben's in the pathway gives like teachers opportunity to jump deeper into all kinds of things.
[00:21:30.99];Margaret Foster; The one that strikes me a lot is cellular respiration and photosynthesis are like they're critical understandings for
[00:21:39.93];Margaret Foster; A carbon cycle model, which is the direction that I was taking that part of the curriculum, but
[00:21:50.22];Margaret Foster; I was trying not to like a life science teacher is going to be all over that they're going to they're going to be excited about taking that part of the curriculum going deeper there.
[00:22:02.82];Margaret Foster; So I was trying to walk a line between
[00:22:07.17];Margaret Foster; Making sure that students have in a solid enough understanding that they can reason about how carbon cycles through the living part of the environment.
[00:22:16.53];Margaret Foster; But
[00:22:18.60];Margaret Foster; Also, keeping the focus of like the focus of the unit here is the carbon cycle and not the processes of photosynthesis or cellular respiration, or any
[00:22:29.16];Margaret Foster; Mm hmm. So, um, so I mean making those documents was useful for me. But I also think that they might like I'm hoping
[00:22:39.51];Margaret Foster; That those documents or something like them would be useful to participants who are thinking about using parts of
[00:22:49.41];Margaret Foster; Or a good portion of or even all of this curriculum to see how it connects to their work and what they feel like their mission is in their classroom. Yeah, I agree with that. And that was what I thought we came up with as sort of a way of
[00:23:08.55];Margaret Foster; Being useful to teachers who who are in a sense pigeonholed into particular areas of science, whether it's biology life science or science, you know, whatever. Right.
[00:23:23.10];Margaret Foster; Which is a very, very different approach. And then we've used in NGS X, but I think it has a great deal of Barrett, it is more useful to high school teachers.
[00:23:34.65];Margaret Foster; Yeah, so I just want to say before we shift gears, if that's what's going on on that. It sounds like what's most useful for me to do next is to really identify a
[00:23:50.88];Margaret Foster; anchor points.
[00:23:52.92];Margaret Foster; Are the things that will both be the, the, the heart of the pathway. Okay, so it needs editing, but also the things that will be
[00:24:03.78];Margaret Foster; Connected to and probably included in each unit of the pathway. Mm hmm. And then the second thing, it sounds like would be really useful is for me to think about how
[00:24:15.30];Margaret Foster; This might be broken up into chunks that are meaningful in and of themselves that take
[00:24:23.25];Margaret Foster; Somewhere in the order of two to three maybe up to six weeks but smaller chunks that would be that could be their own package.
[00:24:34.23];Margaret Foster; So that
[00:24:36.45];Margaret Foster; Is my second thing. And I guess my last question is, do the things that we want to weave into the pathway.
[00:24:46.68];Margaret Foster; Do we want them all from the same chunk, or is it okay if I identify things that seem to exemplify each unit really well, but might be spread more broadly through something that's bigger
[00:25:02.55];Margaret Foster; And then a couple of weeks.
[00:25:10.05];Margaret Foster; I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking more like the, you know, we, I feel like we have a we're matching each of the intro units to the expertise of the big allow folks and so
[00:25:23.10];Margaret Foster; I i think there. I don't know that needs to be like a beginning, middle and end that are the three things that are highlighted it might be the things that are like the most compelling or the most are the
[00:25:41.58];Margaret Foster; He
[00:25:44.64];Margaret Foster; Introduces
[00:25:50.46];Margaret Foster; You
[00:25:51.84];Margaret Foster; Three days.
[00:25:53.94];Margaret Foster; I think it's definitely not something I've seen done well and pathways that
[00:25:58.56];Margaret Foster; Like, oh yeah, I mean you do this, this, this, and then all of a sudden you're here and you know you see every hand go up in the room with teachers like wait, how did you get finger like how did you get those posters and how do you get students to say those things and and and so I think
[00:26:14.88];Margaret Foster; You know, like
[00:26:16.59];Margaret Foster; I don't know that it needs like they, I think the teachers can see like, oh, we started here. It makes sense that we're zooming in on this piece now. And obviously, it'll take some playing around to figure
[00:26:27.48];Margaret Foster; Figure out what that looks like and how we represent that. But there might be like these three key moments of, like, you know, using visualizations. To start off our thinking to like focus in on this unit.
[00:26:40.92];Margaret Foster; You know, the second piece being like working with insane set of data and then being able to come up with new ideas for investigations and new ideas for moving forward.
[00:26:52.44];Margaret Foster; And then like how you put it all together. And so it does kind of follow the ANC framework, you know, of like kicking it off getting into the complexity of everything and then starting to put things together.
[00:27:09.39];Margaret Foster; But I don't, I think it would be
[00:27:11.94];Margaret Foster; I'm just kind of guessing I think for me it would be kind of interesting. If it was like, this is an example from
[00:27:18.66];Margaret Foster; You know, one of the two week things. This is an example from a different one as an example. And I don't think it needs to be, but I like the idea of their of it being not overwhelming with multiple smaller
[00:27:33.63];Margaret Foster; Whatever names for these things because I'm already getting confused. But like, it's
[00:27:41.25];Margaret Foster; Go ahead. I just wanted it sounds like you're saying is
[00:27:46.74];Margaret Foster; The right fit or that like pathway anchor point is the one that best matches the theme of that unit.
[00:27:58.23];Margaret Foster; Right, Sam.
[00:28:01.29];Margaret Foster; And the scientists what what they're bringing to that unit right so Kath with her visualizations and Nick with big data like tools. So, okay.
[00:28:13.59];Margaret Foster; So rather than trying to compact it. Oh, you know, try to make it all work from a smaller piece. It's okay.
[00:28:22.89];Margaret Foster; If it comes from other spots. Okay, that I can work with that. That's good. And I feel like it's almost like I keep thinking through the lens of like what question are we answering for participants.
[00:28:32.85];Margaret Foster; I feel like at that point in the pathway, you know, at the end, towards where whenever it happens. Towards the end of unit one
[00:28:40.38];Margaret Foster; It's gonna be like yeah cathkin do it because she's like super billion, you know, but my my kids can't do it, and then
[00:28:47.31];Margaret Foster; You know, the next step is that that like this is how you know yes they're not writing algorithms for pictures from space. But they're doing this and this is how it's, you know,
[00:29:00.15];Margaret Foster; Happening in classrooms, and I think it's almost answering that question every time.
[00:29:04.74];Margaret Foster; Of, like, yeah, that's really cool. And like I as a participant and pumped and I've learned a bunch of content knowledge and I'm thinking more about different ways to do this. And I'm like, oh,
[00:29:14.91];Margaret Foster; That is cool like that is how that plays out in the classroom, you know, through different you know structures or strategies or mechanisms or whatever.
[00:29:23.46];Margaret Foster; But I get the answers certain tools that you know certainly don't have the sophistication that, you know, Ben T would use or calf calf with us.
[00:29:39.21];Margaret Foster; But they get to the end point which is wanting that wanting the students to really grasp the concepts and what's the progression and the coherence what they're building and understanding towards
[00:29:56.34];Margaret Foster; I liked it did. Speaking of tools.
[00:30:02.04];Margaret Foster; Did you all get a chance to play around with that big data tool or mechanism that Nick.
[00:30:12.45];Margaret Foster; Provided for us. I thought that was really pretty interesting.
[00:30:18.54];Margaret Foster; And
[00:30:20.07];Margaret Foster; What's the kind of tool at a green size that students could use and make sense and understand this interaction of that.
[00:30:33.96];Margaret Foster; I don't know what what you all thought
[00:30:39.36];Margaret Foster; Can students use it. Absolutely. I think that that at least high school level. Um, and with coaching middle school students that they would need, they would needs some additional steps, probably to get in but high school students high school students are there, I think.
[00:31:00.87];Margaret Foster; I find that great to hear. Because I think one of our, you know, our ideas when we met with with the scientist in December, is we were just so wild away.
[00:31:13.86];Margaret Foster; With the various tools they had in their back pocket, and that's what we hope to be able to give to teachers and teachers and turn integrating what was realistic into their classroom so
[00:31:29.28];Margaret Foster; I felt pretty good about that one. TJ and Chris your thoughts.
[00:31:35.10];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I think this is the way anyway. Like, you know, this is exploratory data analysis. So this is really making sense of your data, kind of like one on one. But you can easily pick apart patterns based on if you do like
[00:31:47.10];Margaret Foster; A dotted line graph, whatever, depending on what you put on the different axes. So I think this would be really
[00:31:54.42];Margaret Foster; At first it will probably look a little crazy and intimidating, but if we figure out a way to because this is, I think, exactly what we were talking about
[00:32:03.45];Margaret Foster; As well. Like what kind of tools can we have people use to start making sense of have a huge
[00:32:11.82];Margaret Foster; Data set and being able to not only identify patterns but get a little lost in it but feel a little bit more comfortable with a more robust question at the end, but still
[00:32:21.99];Margaret Foster; Left with wondering a lot like I can mess around with it and do like gaps in temperature. And in my mind, say, you know what
[00:32:29.61];Margaret Foster; I bet temperature is going to change as a function of depth and I can see it, but it still doesn't tell me everything I need to know. So I think they're, they're great, and to reduce a lot in a lot of places. And I think it's really just
[00:32:43.98];Margaret Foster; You know, Excel done in a graphic user interface that you're really using
[00:32:49.29];Margaret Foster; Yeah but done but done and then engaging sort of way. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You don't have to get lost in the in the punching all the numbers and you can just mess with the it's very visual and very
[00:33:01.32];Margaret Foster; I think that was very helpful for students. Oh, yeah. And I think it would be helpful for teachers to I know I heard a lot
[00:33:09.42];Margaret Foster; Would from teachers that they're uncertainty just around these kinds of tools lead them to not introducing them to their students. And so this is this is a great opportunity, I think, to think about
[00:33:23.67];Margaret Foster; When we're identifying areas within the unit.
[00:33:27.96];Margaret Foster; It's not just to say, like, Hey, you know, like, these are some ways that you know you can think about implementing some of these approaches in the classroom. It's also here's some extra practice for you.
[00:33:37.92];Margaret Foster; As a, as an educator, just a, you know, these are these are tools you can mess around with and feel a little bit more comfortable using them in the classroom. So
[00:33:51.39];Margaret Foster; Yeah I would echo, just like I think it helps with what we're talking about in you to to with the like talking about data is a different kind of thing like data is the backbone of science and you
[00:34:06.66];Margaret Foster; It's not a picture in the textbook and I got a question that you have to answer. I think that's how most that's a lot of
[00:34:15.84];Margaret Foster; Teachers, think about the, you know, a chart as, like, what's the right number that I need to get. Is it, you know, the x axis of this and the y goes to here and it's 32 and so most people freak out when they see that
[00:34:30.27];Margaret Foster; That chart or the data table when they're like, whoa. Like, am I gonna have to grab this and I think the tuba like leaned into that and like, now you're just playing around, you just do this and you do that and I think that
[00:34:44.85];Margaret Foster; Is kind of what Nick was saying that like it's this, it's this Plato, you know, of data that you mess around with until you're like, Wait a minute. Now I have a question or I have a better question or now I'm noticing this one you know point thing that sticks out in this
[00:35:04.62];Margaret Foster; Data set so i think it's it's a way of thinking about
[00:35:10.29];Margaret Foster; Change.
[00:35:11.88];Margaret Foster; Now we have access to so much data and so many people are overwhelmed and you know how many of these grants you read or you know they need a new computer scientists, you know, you're, you're studying.
[00:35:26.55];Margaret Foster; You know, trees, and you need a computer scientist to help you sort through the amount of data that you're coming up with. And so I think it's an interesting
[00:35:35.46];Margaret Foster; It's interesting that the the framework put such an emphasis on data and you know computational thinking and everyone's kind of scrambling trying to think about, like, Wait, how do we even do that. Where do we start everyone's like, instead of code robots.
[00:35:54.48];Margaret Foster; Oh, cute robots.
[00:35:56.70];Margaret Foster; Um,
[00:35:58.74];Margaret Foster; I see that
[00:36:03.33];Margaret Foster; I totally forgot what Cygnus say it'll come back. I'm sure it will come back.
[00:36:09.45];Margaret Foster; This might be a good point to, to, like, maybe pause and think about the we were talking about with the coronavirus like because there's so much about. There's
[00:36:23.46];Margaret Foster; The data, the graphs. I've been saving graphs that I see.
[00:36:28.11];Margaret Foster; Where the y axis is all messed up, and it goes you know it's not linear. It doesn't actually have an like I've been sharing them with people, just to kind of see like
[00:36:38.94];Margaret Foster; Look at this graph. And they're like, cool. It looks good, like now look at it like what do you notice like look looks fine. Well, that's what I thought. I mean, people I truly, truly, they're trying to understand
[00:36:55.02];Margaret Foster; Flattening
[00:36:56.94];Margaret Foster; You know, and, and what if this goes back up. But then, this comes down. I mean, what are we in a bad way. Now, is this a hot spot. What's the hot spot or. And so this has given us and challenging. It's challenging us and challenging teachers, I think, to
[00:37:18.27];Margaret Foster; You know, I've been surprised in in
[00:37:21.87];Margaret Foster; John's science class, there's been no right turn towards focusing on a coven as as as and the tools and science that are being used to help you know follow that data and understand it.
[00:37:39.81];Margaret Foster; So I, you know, I'm thinking, why, why couldn't we develop several modules that would take the tools that we privilege in NDS like
[00:37:55.38];Margaret Foster; The kind of, well, and we're getting more and more tools tools that allow students to really play with data, but
[00:38:05.19];Margaret Foster; With the n teachers to play with the data, but the outcome is since making this is what we want. Since making and coherence of data and especially when you have a lot of inputs into your data sets.
[00:38:20.76];Margaret Foster; So I think I heard of it because it's such a think. So it's a triggering topic and I like, I don't think I got it until I was in my quantitative methods course in the doc program and
[00:38:36.54];Margaret Foster; You know, my wife's younger sisters dying of cancer and every problem that we had was okay so 600 people have cancer and 40 of them died of cancer. And so, you know, everybody do the math of how many people died of cancer and literally
[00:38:51.57];Margaret Foster; Every single one that he did and it was so hard to like get anything out of it because I'm like
[00:38:58.83];Margaret Foster; He's talking about this human that I know that you know is dying of cancer. And so I think I know a lot of
[00:39:06.75];Margaret Foster; Districts are thinking about using it, but I wonder about prescribing it or like how many people would sign on to it.
[00:39:13.86];Margaret Foster; But I think it's worth putting out like a you know a few step module. And I don't even know what that would look like, like a half day pathway or something around but that's kind of what I wonder definitely wanted to wade into the water easily and not
[00:39:31.74];Margaret Foster; go whole hog here with a big pathway, but perhaps develop a half day experience yet kind of framing it as like understanding. I was almost thinking practice eight like the obtaining evaluating communicating information like maybe if like because
[00:39:52.26];Margaret Foster; The first two pathways, you know, we're very focused on modeling explanation argumentation. And if we're thinking about data and we're thinking about mathematics and computational thinking
[00:40:02.40];Margaret Foster; Why not go into practice eight and think, like, We're all being inundated with so much data.
[00:40:08.31];Margaret Foster; And it's overwhelming. Like, it takes so much time to look at these graphs and think, like, wait, what is that even telling us, and
[00:40:17.55];Margaret Foster; Even saying to me right Richard Chris and I were meeting and we were talking about modeling for the elementary pathway. And we were you know
[00:40:26.94];Margaret Foster; Reflecting and kind of laughing at a sad way about like the way people are thinking about the models in
[00:40:34.05];Margaret Foster; Right now for, you know, oh, this is the model, what's going to happen on the East Coast, but this is a model of what's going to happen when we open and that like I've got some very political.
[00:40:45.57];Margaret Foster; Right leading people, and in the fam. And they are like, no, no. That models and have me. Where am I on that model. It's like, well, that's not what this model is and so
[00:40:55.26];Margaret Foster; I think we could do something that's maybe, you know, not specific. It's, it's about understanding on packing real, real life events or something, I don't know what the what we know what the name of it is, is it
[00:41:09.15];Margaret Foster; It's related to the work that we're doing with Piccolo, in the sense that we're working with big data.
[00:41:15.84];Margaret Foster; But that's another context is the pandemic context and it, you know, I can see there are all kinds of data sets from your back and and the Spanish flu. Oh, no. I mean, there's a
[00:41:36.84];Margaret Foster; Vast amount of information to bring into a couple of modules.
[00:41:43.35];Margaret Foster; But it's trying to you know what we're challenged to do. And in that climate pathway is to narrow this
[00:41:52.56];Margaret Foster; So that the experience is just not like throwing spaghetti at the wall, but there's some real meeting here.
[00:42:00.69];Margaret Foster; Right. Well, I think that's what I've been thinking about as you guys have been talking is what's the
[00:42:07.29];Margaret Foster; I mean that the pandemics or public health data is just the arena that you're playing in it's not necessarily the
[00:42:18.84];Margaret Foster; Surely the reason for being for the pathway. Right. Like, what is it, what's the, what's the thing that participants would get out of this pathway that makes it necessary, like what what understandings about three dimensional science or whatever is going to
[00:42:40.68];Margaret Foster; Help us build other than just seeing it in a new context.
[00:42:47.52];Margaret Foster; I'm, I don't know, but I think that that would be an important question for me to ask and answer before I felt like, Oh, I get what that's about, other than just the fact that it's
[00:42:58.02];Margaret Foster; Happens to be about a current events you know about a some about something that's going on in the world right now.
[00:43:07.71];Margaret Foster; And then I guess I I got to thinking about this because
[00:43:14.43];Margaret Foster; It's it's around data literacy and how is day literacy being handled in middle school and high school today so that students who are going through this experience, and it's affecting them as much as it's affecting us as adults.
[00:43:35.46];Margaret Foster; Have the ability to participate in a set of learnings in their classroom that helps them interpret their current reality.
[00:43:46.59];Margaret Foster; And I'm not saying every year. We're going to have a pandemic that these these kids are living through one, this is going to be part of their history as it is part of ours. And if you really don't under it's become to politicize so that for kids all they're picking up
[00:44:07.14];Margaret Foster; Is the little is the politics of this rather than the actual interpretation of what's going on in the pandemic.
[00:44:19.68];Margaret Foster; Brew an understanding and working with data points.
[00:44:25.98];Margaret Foster; Don't think it's a really. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. I was gonna say, I think it's super tricky because of the relevance of it. And you know, I think, TJ mentioned as well that some people can be like
[00:44:38.04];Margaret Foster; Like triggered by or it's already so prevalent maybe people don't want to talk about it. But it almost makes me think, like, if you're hanging out with a bunch of like
[00:44:45.57];Margaret Foster; Baseball nerds, then they're going to talk about statistics as like a common language and understanding it, because it's a part of
[00:44:54.96];Margaret Foster; The sport and, you know, they're kind of and it's like, it's the opportunity met the need to understand and so maybe it's a way to really think about
[00:45:03.87];Margaret Foster; How often do we have a situation in life, you know, and we're in education, where
[00:45:09.06];Margaret Foster; There's so much data being chucked at you in a short period of time and really crazy, different ways of looking at it, that's connected to what your what's happening at home.
[00:45:18.69];Margaret Foster; It's connected to what's happening around the world, it's connected to all sorts of things that it it can really maybe it's the time to motivate us to think about
[00:45:29.01];Margaret Foster; Data and understanding it in some way. And I don't know how you know if it's a half day or something. It's not like you're going to drill into everything but maybe if it's kind of like
[00:45:40.50];Margaret Foster; How would you start to think about, you know, some of these current events or some of these of this data kind of volume that allows you to participate in the discussion. You know, so it's like a data literacy kind of
[00:45:55.80];Margaret Foster; not overly intensive, but like, what, what does the different what's, what's this image mean in this image mean if they're from the same day and talking about the same exact thing yet they're not
[00:46:08.46];Margaret Foster; If I interpret them. They're not necessarily telling me the same thing. What kind of questions do I need to ask. So I can understand it in more
[00:46:16.68];Margaret Foster; I guess detail, you know, and so when you're thinking about these models like some models are so complicated that if anything changes.
[00:46:25.83];Margaret Foster; The, the validity of that model is no longer what it was when it like spit out of the computer and like that moment when it was like
[00:46:33.96];Margaret Foster; Like a hot fresh bread out of the oven. It was really, really robust and reliable, but every minute after it might not be. And so what is that, well, it gets more stale and carry out your example.
[00:46:46.77];Margaret Foster; The stay on this begins to set in. No, I just, yeah. So I love that and I think
[00:46:52.98];Margaret Foster; That that might be going off what you're saying. Chris, I like that spin that it's it's maybe it's a it's a data literacy and personal relevance piece because the
[00:47:03.18];Margaret Foster; Everybody keeps talking about the, you know, quote unquote correct amount of time that you should be see looking at the news to get your daily news.
[00:47:13.50];Margaret Foster; And and I think it'd be interesting to see like, what are you going, where do you go, where do you even start. What kind of, what is the news. What are you trying to get a pain for information.
[00:47:24.87];Margaret Foster; And then I liked the baseball example. Like, I wonder if they're wonderful within this half day. And again, we
[00:47:32.13];Margaret Foster; Were always ambitious, but I want to within this half day we use code as the, you know, it's a personal relevance thing because it
[00:47:39.69];Margaret Foster; Because it's forced upon us. And so it's not that, you know, we're going to spend in this whole pathway thinking about code. But we have to because it's affecting everyone. And so maybe that becomes the context.
[00:47:53.40];Margaret Foster; And then we use a couple of key sets of tools to then unpack some data set that is relevant to you and it might be something like baseball data or you know fantasy football or weather like the
[00:48:08.85];Margaret Foster; Word on fire doc market or like surfing, like all the kids that were surfing and Delaware, like the their teachers were all saying, Oh, my God. They just want to know about the waves like fine like that's what they want to know about or
[00:48:22.17];Margaret Foster; They'll stocking fish like it could be anything, and ended applies the same way no matter what they're focused on. And so maybe Kobe becomes the context and the tools allow us to connect to, you know,
[00:48:39.36];Margaret Foster; We're all going to be impacted by data, you know, house markets or, you know, the
[00:48:46.53];Margaret Foster; Unemployment like the you know all that like there's so there's so much data that's coming out of daily. And so I do like that. I would be interested in putting together working
[00:48:57.48];Margaret Foster; Like
[00:48:59.61];Margaret Foster; It would have to be like NGS FX pathway concentrate or like we're gonna do this for half a day, you add the water and go outside. Make sure outside before you have to water.
[00:49:09.84];Margaret Foster; It. And I think it's almost like dependent. And so when you think about all this coronavirus baby. The coven 19 data.
[00:49:19.26];Margaret Foster; It really is getting up based on what your question is, it can help you go find like to do when you're talking about, like, what's the news. You want to go find out about, well, you have to have a question and then you have to know what's reasonably going to help you.
[00:49:33.27];Margaret Foster; grapple with that question. It's not going to serve through all the top images on CNN or Fox News or MSNBC or wire. Those are all coming at you with a very specific
[00:49:45.66];Margaret Foster; You know, statistical reason for introducing these data to you or even depending how you just even
[00:49:54.24];Margaret Foster; You know, if you use a logarithmic scale or just a temperature scale of Celsius is going to, you're going to have very different ways of interpreting what you're seeing, you know, and so like just just those little insights
[00:50:07.47];Margaret Foster; Can be really, really useful. And so just be able, with the thermometer. The, you know, infrared thermometer on your forehead. We were like, oh my god, it's this number. What is, what is it supposed to be.
[00:50:19.89];Margaret Foster; I don't know 28.2. Yeah. What is it like and you know they're talking about here in Connecticut about Mohegan Sun is, you know, on
[00:50:29.85];Margaret Foster; Land that they can do kind of what they want to do. And so they're going to open. They're going to open. They're going to change all their security cameras to heat cameras and so everyone's like, well, what he should I be what's my
[00:50:42.93];Margaret Foster; Feet. It's like, that's not the question like what is. And so I think everyone is struggling with it and it is, it would be interesting to put it out there and I will
[00:50:56.22];Margaret Foster; As I model this over. I think one of the reasons that this
[00:51:03.69];Margaret Foster; You know decisions that governors are making decisions that date representatives are making our mayor's are making or business people are making
[00:51:13.14];Margaret Foster; Have become so politicized is that I don't know where they don't know what else to put out there in terms of what they're basing their decision on and they're not basing in many instances to not making basing their decision on understanding what the data is telling them.
[00:51:32.37];Margaret Foster; It's
[00:51:33.96];Margaret Foster; I find this all a little scary.
[00:51:37.53];Margaret Foster; Well, I think. So if we can pump a little data literacy
[00:51:42.72];Margaret Foster; Into the world in our, our particular way of doing it.
[00:51:47.85];Margaret Foster; You know, why not, I think, I think it's like, as I've been listening to everybody. The first, my first thought is, this is huge. There is so much to
[00:51:59.04];Margaret Foster; data literacy, which is one of the things that makes it so challenging
[00:52:03.66];Margaret Foster; I wonder like what it is that you do in half a day that makes it really valuable like that would that'll be a really interesting question to figure out like
[00:52:14.73];Margaret Foster; What can you give people in that short period of time. It's going to actually I think it has to be more than a half a day. I'm sorry. I think it's a day, right, we just find you know where to be the facilitator and
[00:52:31.23];Margaret Foster; Just talk really fast.
[00:52:33.84];Margaret Foster; Micro Machines. You guys remember those
[00:52:38.16];Margaret Foster; So, but I think like that. It's a really interesting question. And I think it's really important because as Jeanne was saying like, I think this is where I public trust in science is either forged or lost, right, because
[00:52:58.05];Margaret Foster; Uh, when people feel like
[00:53:02.52];Margaret Foster; A thing is it's the things that I heard when I was I was growing up about nutrition and science. It's like, oh, they just keep changing their minds first butter is good for that it's bad for you, then you're supposed to eat margarine and now margins bad for you again.
[00:53:18.84];Margaret Foster; You know, just wait five minutes, and all of a sudden, whatever you're doing will be healthy, right, like you have that that mentality and I can totally see where that impression comes from
[00:53:30.39];Margaret Foster; In in people. And I also
[00:53:34.98];Margaret Foster; I don't know i think i think it's
[00:53:37.83];Margaret Foster; I think it's ambitious and good, but like I really curious to see where
[00:53:45.78];Margaret Foster; What you could do in that space of time. That would give people something actionable that they can take back to classrooms that would help to advance that I was also really thinking that what
[00:54:00.48];Margaret Foster; what Chris was saying strikes me as it's like the opposite problem that we're thinking about in the climate pathway.
[00:54:10.74];Margaret Foster; Because in the climate pathway we have these enormous data sets that are raw the raw data. And so we're trying to just poke around in them and see what kind of meaning comes out of them like
[00:54:24.33];Margaret Foster; You know, temperature versus depth. Hey there, it seems to follow a pattern, but there's this anomaly over here like maybe we should investigate that like that, is that that's what we're doing in the climate pathway.
[00:54:38.52];Margaret Foster; But if you do that with the data that comes to you through USA Today is not going to be very productive and like Chris was saying like
[00:54:49.35];Margaret Foster; Porton sometimes in those contexts to really start with a question so that you can read that data, which has already been digested much more critically
[00:55:00.90];Margaret Foster; Like, that's something that feels like it's got firm footing to me.
[00:55:07.11];Margaret Foster; And thinking about, like, kind of the whole. It reminds me of doing a research proposal.
[00:55:12.06];Margaret Foster; Back in like grad school when I was writing grants you go and you you're you're looking through other people's methods.
[00:55:18.93];Margaret Foster; In their in their published papers and you're looking for their
[00:55:23.01];Margaret Foster; Their research question because you want to pull something from it. That's useful that supports you know you found this gap in our understanding and other people tried, but they fell short because maybe they didn't
[00:55:35.10];Margaret Foster; Sample over enough months and you're saying, you know, I want to sample more maybe less frequently. But over more months. So I'm going to provide this as value to this, this, you know,
[00:55:48.48];Margaret Foster; This body of research, though, it's almost at to borrow from what you're saying, Ben. It's like, so that's an intuitive tool set that maybe
[00:55:57.30];Margaret Foster; I've developed over time. I didn't start with it, but it's very natural to say
[00:56:02.82];Margaret Foster; Let's start with what question am I thinking about where did this data come from what question. Were they thinking about you know what time frame, was it collected people already publishing, you know,
[00:56:14.76];Margaret Foster; Research papers that say, you know, based on three weeks of sampling certain people, we can say this about coronavirus spread and so like those are really
[00:56:25.98];Margaret Foster; You know, how can we come up with those really thought provoking questions, almost that people can then start to I guess maybe answer on their own or start to build. Just a little, little bit of that mindset around
[00:56:40.41];Margaret Foster; Maybe even it's just as what is your question, because as TJ said to thinking about, you know, like in
[00:56:45.09];Margaret Foster; The sports world there's millions of ways to make this relatable and I'm sure in the stock market world there are as well. You know, people are always coming out with new ways to combine different variables to tell you some sort of
[00:56:58.29];Margaret Foster; Rating System for something, you know, and so
[00:57:02.43];Margaret Foster; Why don't we try to figure out how we can extend that toolkit or that little lens to other folks because I do agree and with the butter question. It's almost like the first thing I asked as well.
[00:57:13.17];Margaret Foster; Who did they study, you know, right, because butters really good for some people, you know, or when they say like we did a phone call interview to determine which governors have a high approval rating.
[00:57:25.44];Margaret Foster; And they called the same they called a set amount of people and in certain states they can say it's statistically significant, but in some states they they say it's not statistically significant. So
[00:57:38.52];Margaret Foster; How many people did they even have to call you know like they've never called me. But, you know, like so. It makes me wonder. There's a lot of simplified questions out there like there's a lot of simple ways people are presenting things that
[00:57:49.86];Margaret Foster; We might be able to to draw in but I don't know, it's a lot to think about in three hours or four hours.
[00:58:00.36];Margaret Foster; Before date is
[00:58:04.44];Margaret Foster; Here 10 or 10
[00:58:10.59];Margaret Foster; I am wondering if people, people know I'm the cognitive sciences Daniel Willingham
[00:58:18.84];Margaret Foster; He's um he wrote a book that was very interesting to me a couple years ago called when can you trust the experts. I dropped a link in the Minutes to it if anyone's interested but this has been thinking about that a lot.
[00:58:34.71];Margaret Foster; He doesn't from the perspective of a teacher, trying to look at educational research. But if they're just the questions that come from science in public use all the time.
[00:58:44.85];Margaret Foster; Which are, you know, how do I as somebody who doesn't have the background in a particular field and don't know
[00:58:55.26];Margaret Foster; Like, what's it what what are the important constants are controls in a in an experiments even um or
[00:59:04.86];Margaret Foster; What constitutes a sizable data sets and the given context of what we're talking about. One of the things he points out is that, like, the reason that we have experts in so many different fields.
[00:59:18.63];Margaret Foster; Is because it takes a long time to get to know the mistakes that have already been made in that field, right, you have to kind of recreate the process of making those mistakes yourself and Hello there.
[00:59:35.43];Margaret Foster; And
[00:59:37.47];Margaret Foster; And so he puts forward and arguments in that particular book about
[00:59:44.70];Margaret Foster; How everyone at some point asked to take responsibility for being a part of a scientist in that conversation.
[00:59:53.37];Margaret Foster; And then at some point you have to recognize that you're not going to be able to get a PhD in the subject and won't be able to be as critical a reader in it or a scientist in it.
[01:00:03.45];Margaret Foster; As other people are going to be able to be and that is a really interesting tension. I think when you're talking about this science and engineering practice.
[01:00:18.12];Margaret Foster; Because eventually
[01:00:21.27];Margaret Foster; At some points you're
[01:00:24.96];Margaret Foster; Like I have to consume data that somebody else with more expertise is digested and I can be critical of it to a certain point.
[01:00:34.95];Margaret Foster; And then I've brands, the limits of my own time. So,
[01:00:39.84];Margaret Foster; I think something in that pathway that addressed questions like that would be really interesting.
[01:00:48.96];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what it would look like, but it would be, it would be right. Really territory.
[01:00:55.98];Margaret Foster; Agree. I just bought that book. And I feel like I need to have less meetings because I just got the book from Nick from our last meeting just arrived steal like an artist, my pile is growing.
[01:01:12.87];Margaret Foster; Well,
[01:01:14.55];Margaret Foster; I really, really appreciate you putting your minds and voices to this discussion, I
[01:01:24.21];Margaret Foster; I think we want to wait into this carefully.
[01:01:28.41];Margaret Foster; But at least I'm sensing
[01:01:32.31];Margaret Foster; At this moment in time as we leave this conversation is it that the three of you have interest.
[01:01:40.92];Margaret Foster; In pursuing a something that's not too big.
[01:01:46.59];Margaret Foster; That is in, in many respects, has a very practical overlay for teachers.
[01:01:54.69];Margaret Foster; And if I can't. I really can't see it as being any less than a day.
[01:02:02.07];Margaret Foster; And
[01:02:06.06];Margaret Foster; I think we should continue to turn the silver in our minds, and I think I can get funding for this. I really do. Because I think it's been a topic that just no one is picking up
[01:02:20.82];Margaret Foster; And Jim, you know, I wonder if it's even a neat opportunity to think about if it is even a day. What's that day look like maybe it's an hour than two and a half hours then two and a half hours with a little bit of
[01:02:33.18];Margaret Foster; You know stuff happening in between or stuff before. Who knows, just to kind of maximize that time if it's going to be done current in the current environment and done virtually versus an in person.
[01:02:46.14];Margaret Foster; You know, well, that, that, that's it. I mean, we don't know whether we'll be back face to face in the old NDS sex way.
[01:02:57.90];Margaret Foster; But you know we talking the next four months. But Ben and I were talking about this before you joined us. And the fact that
[01:03:07.26];Margaret Foster; John school is planning graduate high school graduation for seniors in August, but
[01:03:13.56];Margaret Foster; You know, who knows.
[01:03:16.20];Margaret Foster; Who knows, we need a model, we need a model. Yeah, really.
[01:03:21.45];Margaret Foster; Yeah, she here right girl and I put in the in the Minutes.
[01:03:28.65];Margaret Foster; The USF grant that Laura's angry and pray Sadler got around building curriculum materials for I believe it's just for high school students.
[01:03:41.40];Margaret Foster; High school students and they started building out modules and got one of those rapid NSF grants.
[01:03:50.85];Margaret Foster; Ability. I think that
[01:03:53.64];Margaret Foster; What we're turning around here.
[01:03:57.75];Margaret Foster; Could be a rapper, which is yes that's well that's how we got started.
[01:04:05.37];Margaret Foster; Was through rapid grants. So, but we, I don't want to take our attention away from climate.
[01:04:14.67];Margaret Foster; But all of this takes a little research. I have a couple of names. Now, at age that are working on developing these sorts of courses, not necessarily for k 12 or middle and high school. It's but
[01:04:32.97];Margaret Foster; For for educators, so I'll see what I find out there and bring it back to the discussion. Are we having a little something to eat there Lily.
[01:04:45.48];Margaret Foster; Yes. Is that what you're wearing on your chin, you know, yeah, she had a little yogurt snack and she's getting better and better at the spoon and the end the fork and now she refuses to let anyone really theater, unless it's like myself, you're close to bedtime. Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:05.16];Margaret Foster; I sometimes, it ends up in other places.
[01:05:09.72];Margaret Foster; Okay, so just just to review.
[01:05:17.40];Margaret Foster; Then, do you want to go back through and and find those anchor points and share that kind of analysis with this before we
[01:05:28.14];Margaret Foster; Get in looking at the curriculum and sort of
[01:05:33.60];Margaret Foster; Coming to that at least individual decision before we get back together about what seems to us like the non negotiable that could go in to
[01:05:47.70];Margaret Foster; The pathway or you a uses stepping up points.
[01:05:54.06];Margaret Foster; In some way that
[01:05:58.83];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I feel like you need to give us a little bit more direction on what on what you would like us to do. And if you want to do some work first do it and then shoot a note, our way.
[01:06:12.60];Margaret Foster; Okay, so let me. Um, how about this. Yeah. What about like by
[01:06:19.32];Margaret Foster; Tuesday. What if I sent you a list of potential List of potentials. So, and I try to match them up by unit.
[01:06:30.30];Margaret Foster; And I'm with the thinking about the expertise of our scientists guides for each unit and trying to match those and I'll try to send I'll try to send a couple for each so that
[01:06:47.04];Margaret Foster; As people are thinking about it. You might suggest one or what are the advantages are of one of those over another. Does that sound.
[01:07:00.81];Margaret Foster; Oh dear.
[01:07:03.48];Margaret Foster; Are you okay with that Chris Yeah, that'd be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And Chris, you're gonna do some organizing for us and send up a flare when that's ready. Yep, yep, or we'll go through it together next week.
[01:07:21.78];Margaret Foster; And TJ, you'll just be
[01:07:25.50];Margaret Foster; Too, too. Okay, like I want to get at least the detail that we have in Unit one and hopefully by next week and get into unit three. I'm looking forward to, you know, our meeting tomorrow to start
[01:07:41.34];Margaret Foster; You know, plug in some seeds for the what that story is because I think that's the one for me. That is the most foggy
[01:07:52.65];Margaret Foster; Because we, you know, we definitely need to wrap things up. We'd show how to build
[01:07:58.17];Margaret Foster; An explanation or an argument and put things together, but I feel like Ben tease work is so complex, not that, you know, Catherine Nick's isn't
[01:08:10.05];Margaret Foster; But you know, I think, from because he's doing science and it's and at the director role and so like I i wonder
[01:08:19.92];Margaret Foster; I'm kind of hopeful that there is a story in there of like the things that he thinks are important to figure out and share. And I think that would be a nice wrap up to the big low work that like he will put in for these larger grants to say these bigger stories because he thinks that
[01:08:41.79];Margaret Foster; I don't know. Uh, well, I don't know what he thinks. But I think there's like a if there was like a if this is so important than I'm going to do this, then that might be like a nice way of building towards something bigger than a car and
[01:08:58.38];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I'm looking forward to just kind of thing. What he says it's almost like a claim evidence reasoning critique and there's going to be other parts that are going to be involved. I think because a big
[01:09:10.20];Margaret Foster; Point is going to be like, how do you know what you did was was any good. How do you know what other people did was any good. And then how do you convey all of that to folks. So I'm interested as well.
[01:09:22.59];Margaret Foster; I'm interested in when his work interfaces with MCS or with caps.
[01:09:29.91];Margaret Foster; And so we can begin to get a little bit of that, you know, cross fertilization.
[01:09:36.93];Margaret Foster; interaction among the three scientists more visible and in in the work.
[01:09:44.70];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I don't think I thought of that, like the overall. Maybe we need something that's like all of the the community of Bigelow.
[01:09:55.14];Margaret Foster; And like, how did they, how do they work together and build off of each other if if they do, and then how does that mirror the kind of work that we want happening in in 6612 classrooms.
[01:10:07.98];Margaret Foster; Yeah, I think, I think that that's the video that we need to make up for them having that conversation and
[01:10:17.19];Margaret Foster; That I need to hear a little bit more about Ben's work tomorrow, and I'm not real clear on it. I'm not real clear on it.
[01:10:24.90];Margaret Foster; Okay. Hey, thanks so much these these these are speaking of anchor points. These meetings are truly anchor points for me. So yeah, OK, we'll see in the morning.
[01:10:41.82];Margaret Foster; morning or the afternoon.
[01:10:44.91];Margaret Foster; Thought it was early. Yeah, I thought it was
[01:10:49.08];Margaret Foster; All right.
[01:10:51.27];Margaret Foster; I'm gonna
[01:10:52.71];Margaret Foster; check my calendar. Yeah.
[01:10:56.61];Margaret Foster; Yeah okay we'll see in the afternoon. All right.
