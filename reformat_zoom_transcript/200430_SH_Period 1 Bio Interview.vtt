1
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.200
Margaret Foster: Hello, how are you

2
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.210
Tina Chiem: I'm good, how are you

3
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.410
Margaret Foster: I'm good. I think the recording is working and meeting waiting room so

4
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.750
Tina Chiem: Oh sure, yeah.

5
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.350
Margaret Foster: How are you doing lots of finals and stuff.

6
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.560
Tina Chiem: Um, it's

7
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.860
Tina Chiem: Not a lot, but I am not working on them as diligently as I should be

8
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:26.970
Margaret Foster: Sarah and I found out earlier this week that the class that I'm teaching for her is pass fail and like had been before, which we didn't realize until recently. And so I kind of told them all on Tuesday. You know, I like I do understand if this changes how much

9
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.820
Margaret Foster: Like energy you put into the final but please like tell me if you are planning on on you know either.

10
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.610
Margaret Foster: Not head to get in or like having specifically

11
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.850
Margaret Foster: Oh my gosh, Ashley, I found it actually

12
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.490
Tina Chiem: Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.480
Margaret Foster: No, there's someone in the waiting room and I don't know.

14
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.180
Margaret Foster: Here, Sarah.

15
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.280
smichaels: Hi there.

16
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.600
Margaret Foster: Hi Sarah.

17
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.860
Margaret Foster: We have one

18
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.210
Margaret Foster: And potentially Sherman, but I'm not sure in the waiting room. Should I wait until Sue and Jessica here. Just let them in.

19
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.610
smichaels: Wow, it's nine minutes early.

20
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.890
smichaels: I'm trying to print off the questions and my printer just

21
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.500
smichaels: Let's keep let's wait a little bit

22
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.790
Margaret Foster: Yesterday, saying that Sherman este

23
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.900
Margaret Foster: Or said that he can download the app. So asked for.

24
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.840
Margaret Foster: The call it information, which is why I'm wondering if this is him. It just says iPhone. They actually but there's no Ashley in our class.

25
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:11.790
Margaret Foster: But I wrote back with the instructions of, like, I tried it out myself. And so he should just be hearing like a waiting room type thing like he's on hold, is what the recording will say so. Yeah.

26
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.840
Okay.

27
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560
smichaels: All right, let me think about how to practice.

28
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.710
smichaels: I don't know how do you get the blue color on the Google Doc just

29
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.660
Margaret Foster: I just sent it to you, Sarah as a boy.

30
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.830
smichaels: I got I got I

31
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.090
smichaels: Got it. But I'm wondering how you if I would have done it myself.

32
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.420
Margaret Foster: So the way that you do it is you go to File Page Setup and page color.

33
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.710
Margaret Foster: The iPhone left. So hopefully they'll call back in like five minutes.

34
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:54.750
Margaret Foster: And the. Yeah. So I've been trying to look at my documents as some version of not white because it

35
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.410
Margaret Foster: For me it's a similar function to like dimming a screen, it makes it easier on your eyes.

36
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.240
Margaret Foster: printed document. It makes more sense to have a view black and white.

37
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.510
smichaels: Yeah, I didn't want to use all that blue ink just for printing

38
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.440
Huh.

39
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.090
smichaels: Yep.

40
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.040
smichaels: Yeah. All right.

41
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.320
Margaret Foster: Tina. What's that photo from

42
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.950
Tina Chiem: It's from ACS is the Lunar New Year. Back in January.

43
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.510
Tina Chiem: Was it's actually a group photo but I cropped it out because

44
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.140
Tina Chiem: Like

45
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.690
Tina Chiem: I was like, it's fine, because the quality is good enough that I can prop it and then it'll still like not be pixel

46
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.430
Margaret Foster: Looks good.

47
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.630
Yeah.

48
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.610
Margaret Foster: I feel it's very interesting. I feel like there's very different norms around like

49
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.510
Margaret Foster: When to have your video up based on like

50
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.320
Margaret Foster: Generation, but also like everybody. I feel like

51
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.000
Margaret Foster: At least I've seen a lot of people whose video is off, just because

52
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.510
Margaret Foster: The like the the bandwidth isn't enough to support both video and audio so like

53
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.260
Yeah.

54
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.350
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

55
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.180
Tina Chiem: Yeah, my video is currently off because I'm on my computer on zoom and my camera on my computer does not work.

56
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.220
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

57
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:51.690
Margaret Foster: Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting I in the class I was taking it be you all of the students like and they're all graduate students that might be different, like whenever we would take a break or like whenever anybody would walk away from the camera, they would turn off their, their video

58
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.000
Margaret Foster: Oh, yeah.

59
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.440
Margaret Foster: Which is interesting.

60
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.180
Margaret Foster: And there's

61
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.250
smichaels: All right.

62
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.300
Margaret Foster: Hello. So we had a

63
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.390
Margaret Foster: An iPhone from Ashley in the waiting room about five minutes ago, but they left. So I'm assuming, they'll come back.

64
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.430
Yeah.

65
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.770
Margaret Foster: Oh, so you're muted. I'm sorry.

66
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.330
sue snay: How do the people in the waiting room know that there's a meeting going on. Does it actually say on their end

67
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:50.520
Margaret Foster: Yeah, so I, um, it's different if it's a phone call versus a like if you're using a phone or computer for the phone at Pace, it basically just puts you on hold and are like, Oh, like you're in the waiting room you're on hold the host will let you in soon.

68
00:06:51.630 --> 00:07:01.650
Margaret Foster: And then the boat for for a video call meeting it like there's a message that just says, like you're in the waiting room host will let you in. Soon, basically.

69
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.250
Margaret Foster: Just fear, just say there was an iPhone in the waiting room.

70
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.160
Margaret Foster: About six minutes ago so very early.

71
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.170
Margaret Foster: So I decided to wait for more of us to comfort.

72
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.980
Margaret Foster: The iPhone went away, but I'm assuming so

73
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:25.380
smichaels: Um, so I just. Is there, is there anyone. Um, is there, it can we invite people in from the waiting you

74
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.470
Margaret Foster: Know there's nobody in it now. So

75
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.540
smichaels: You just, you can't

76
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.360
Jessica Zaleski: Here's Pamela. Yes, I was gonna say

77
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.720
Jessica Zaleski: She was just in a meeting with me for an hour for ESL

78
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.500
sue snay: And she said she was

79
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.900
Margaret Foster: Oh, oh my gosh, what

80
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:55.560
Jessica Zaleski: She told me five times that she was coming to this, I had, I just had a Google meet with five of my students came. I was so thrilled. It was amazing, like

81
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:04.590
Jessica Zaleski: For I haven't seen since we got out of school. So it was off and they're going to start texting their friends. So I think this might pick up some momentum here, you know,

82
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.320
Margaret Foster: Very coming

83
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:20.100
Margaret Foster: I did get a message from a Nisha and also have cow that they can't come because they have exams this afternoon so unfortunate for Portuguese, but we will do our best and it'll be fun.

84
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.410
smichaels: Yeah.

85
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.410
sue snay: Wow, you guys have much better lighting. I look like I'm on my deathbed.

86
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.030
Margaret Foster: You

87
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.610
sue snay: Very

88
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.040
sue snay: much taller than I do.

89
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.360
sue snay: Can turn the spotlight on hmm

90
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.130
We know what

91
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.090
sue snay: We ended up like everybody

92
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.790
smichaels: Say that again. What

93
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.470
sue snay: I did before we get to the end and I will be the last day. Oh.

94
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.580
smichaels: Yeah.

95
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:20.190
Margaret Foster: I'm suing Jess, I forgot to ask at the end of our meeting yesterday, if, if I should go ahead and schedule for 930 to 11 on Wednesday.

96
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.410
Margaret Foster: Or if you want to wait until you know more about your schedule for next week before scheduling a meeting.

97
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:41.910
sue snay: Apparently, we have to schedule a lot more meetings. We just had our faculty and and now they're suggesting that we work together as an entire team of biology teachers to do the same.

98
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.850
sue snay: Lesson template according to what death. He has sent down to us.

99
00:09:48.390 --> 00:10:02.940
sue snay: So we're gonna have to try to schedule a South biology team, which I don't even know how that's going to leave amber because their suggestion was to make sure that everybody was following the same basic topics that death. He has set forth

100
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:03.780
smichaels: That's fine.

101
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.950
Whatever.

102
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:22.290
sue snay: I'm not really even sure how it's going to go. I did invite say our my student teacher who's been doing 910 910 and 11 to talk with Jeff and I after this meeting to see if we leave it.

103
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.100
smichaels: To be a missing.

104
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:38.250
sue snay: And then we have to figure out how to get on the same page with the other three to five biology teachers as three regular bio teachers and two that are in the STEP program. So I'm sure they're gonna have to be part of it too. So there's going to be

105
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:52.560
Jessica Zaleski: Well, I sent. Um, I had to stay on that meeting as one of the Google traffic meeting after and I said to Jeff, I don't see how scheduling it by department is going to work because

106
00:10:53.070 --> 00:11:03.630
Jessica Zaleski: Kids have to science classes or two math classes or two ESL classes. So how is that going to work and I sent him the template for what Grafton is doing with

107
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.230
Jessica Zaleski: You know, they basically have like a period one period to period three for just 25 minutes

108
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:21.720
Jessica Zaleski: And they rotate through their seven periods schedule twice in a week. And even if we did it once in a week. You know what I mean. For 20 minutes of some type of live interaction.

109
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:28.110
Jessica Zaleski: It. We have to have a schedule this idea that they're saying of just teachers figure it out and

110
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:38.520
Jessica Zaleski: Hopefully you don't overlap. I mean, and I understand where Jeff is coming from because we know that the Union will push back on this and he just doesn't want to waste a lot of time coming up with something that's not going to

111
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:47.730
Jessica Zaleski: Ultimately be feasible, but to me as a teacher, it's way more frustrating to just try to schedule these things when I'm

112
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.510
Margaret Foster: Here's time

113
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.070
Jessica Zaleski: Oh, good, good.

114
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.460
sue snay: Hey, Pamela Hi Pamela

115
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.740

Jessica Zaleski: There we go.

118
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.090
Jessica Zaleski: How are you

119
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:11.460
I

120
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.820
sue snay: Haven't seen you. Yeah, it's really nice to see you.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.300
smichaels: How you doing,

sue snay: being grounded.

124
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.420
Jessica Zaleski: But you're very happy. Right. Pamela

Jessica Zaleski: Very happy about em Cass.

126
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.610
Pamela: Yeah yeah

127
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.280
Pamela: You did awesome. We're very proud of you.

Jessica Zaleski: It's wonderful. Very good. Very, very good.

129
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:55.920
Jessica Zaleski: Good, good.

130
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.530
sue snay: Yeah, make sure you take some time to celebrate how well you did on those

131
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.140
sue snay: Before you think about any other challenges out of you.

132
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.180
sue snay: Yeah, that's a big deal.

133
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.280
Jessica Zaleski: Worry about English

134
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.070
Jessica Zaleski: You will pass the English. Don't worry about it.

135
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.360
Pamela: You know,

136
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.280
Pamela: I am very good at English

137
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:40.410
Jessica Zaleski: No you're not. Pamela you're doing an excellent job you only came to Wister last summer and you only had school for September, October, November, December 25. I mean, you know, not even seven months, six months in an American school practicing English you are doing an excellent job.

138
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.970
Pamela: You really are going

139
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.280
Pamela: To send them later. But

140
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.480
Pamela: Yeah.

141
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.820
Pamela: I am very shy.

142
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:48.840
Jessica Zaleski: I know

143
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.300
Jessica Zaleski: No, that's okay, just keep practicing

144
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.200
smichaels: Do you think we should

145
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.660
smichaels: So Pamela is your first language Spanish

146
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.760
Pamela: Portuguese

147
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:08.940
Pamela: No.

148
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:09.930
Jessica Zaleski: No.

149
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.950
Is different.

150
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.440
Pamela: I

151
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.590

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.120
smichaels: Was there anything

316
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:48.780
smichaels: That you learned in class that was on the m casts. Do you remember anything about the M cast test that you understood or could answer because of what you did.

317
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.740
smichaels: In school and class after school.

318
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:55.770
Naiara Da Silva (Student): Everything.

319
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.420
Naiara Da Silva (Student): I'M READING READING AND I'M TRYING.

320
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:20.070
smichaels: Can you guys think about any activities that you liked a lot from from from period one from bio to

321
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:26.010
smichaels: Or that you learned a lot from any activities that you did during the year.

322
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.160
smichaels: That you really liked

323
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.170
Naiara Da Silva (Student): DNA.

324
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.270
smichaels: More

325
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.150
Pamela: Our name.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.520
sue snay: Yeah.

328
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.220
smichaels: I'm

329
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:28.050
smichaels: Sewer Jess, the snare missy. Can you think of any activities that come to mind from what you did that, that they might remember that Pamela, and I are might react. Right. Remember

330
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.860
Jessica Zaleski: Let's see. Pamela, and I are. Do you remember when we played the game.

331
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.250
Jessica Zaleski: When the moose on the board and the moose had babies and

332
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.000
Jessica Zaleski: We had to say.

333
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.700
Jessica Zaleski: They lived or they died.

334
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:51.570
Jessica Zaleski: And if they had babies or offspring and we did it on the tables with the little cards. Do you remember that game.

335
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.530
Pamela: Yes, yeah.

336
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:57.510
Jessica Zaleski: Yeah, a little. Okay. Did you enjoy that game was it fun for you.

337
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.650
Yeah.

338
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:09.360
Jessica Zaleski: It was very fun. Okay. Do you think it helped you to understand what we were talking about what in learning about in class.

339
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.820
Naiara Da Silva (Student): Yes.

340
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:20.400
smichaels: Okay, was there anything on the m casts that had to do with population dynamics or

341
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.120
smichaels: A population growing or

342
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.670
smichaels: getting smaller.

343
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.150
smichaels: Did they test you about any of that on the zoom cast

344
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.800
Naiara Da Silva (Student): As I said, it was a bunch of things, you know,

345
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.260
sue snay: What questions that might have asked

346
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.410
sue snay: Why or how populations.

347
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.350
sue snay: Grow or decline.

348
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.210

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.900
Pamela: You know,

350
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.160
Jessica Zaleski: No, it's hard to remember

351
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:10.950
Jessica Zaleski: It is, I mean, you took that test. She almost. I mean, three months ago now and

352
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:28.230
Jessica Zaleski: You know, even, even then we know that the language on the test was challenging and difficult for you, so I'm probably if we asked you these questions closer to the task you, you remember, but it's hard to remember. You know, it's hard to remember that far back.

353
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.310
Jessica Zaleski: I'm trying to think of some other

354
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:40.920
smichaels: Pipe Cleaners with the, the twins and making a baby a boy or girl.

355

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:29.250
smichaels: That's great.

410
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.330
smichaels: It's great to have you.

411
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:32.400
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): lost track time

412
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:40.350
smichaels: So definitely, um, we're talking about the fact that all of you pass the M casts

413
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:41.640
sue snay: And

414
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:54.210
smichaels: General, the class this class did really well on the m casts, and we're trying to understand what kinds of things helped and what you liked about the way

415
00:34:55.290 --> 00:35:12.330
smichaels: Missy and misnamed taught and also. So we're just asking you questions about what what was helpful. What wasn't helpful and and you can talk, you guys can talk in Portuguese we'll, we'll do the best we can to understand you.

416
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.570
smichaels: And leave

417
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:21.660
Margaret Foster: Them right now hack Elsa, the exam. She couldn't be here, but she says hi and she's really sad.

418
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.250
Margaret Foster: Yeah.

419
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.000
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Um,

420
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:43.800
smichaels: So one last question that misnamed ask is, is. Did you guys have as much discussion and talking in small groups and whole class discussions or did the teacher tell you more talk more

421
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.570
smichaels: In Brazil.

422
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.400
And Brazil.

423
00:35:49.230 --> 00:36:02.730
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So it was usually like let's get your explains, and it's a whole conversation with the whole class, including the teacher. So it's kind of both. So the teacher explains and and we talk like us.

424
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.540
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So yeah, it's kind of like

425
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.100
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): half half

426
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.070
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): I think is more the teacher explain because sometimes we get lost in the conversation.

427
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.950
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): And start talking about it and then things

428
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.430
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So has to enter the thing in

429
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.900
smichaels: Can you say that in Portuguese just to make sure everybody understood

430
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.330
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Um,

431
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.380
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): No, but I was you know me talking wrestling professor

432
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.920
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): When I click was a supporter that she

433
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.780
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Was always come back converse I society for the converse so interesting open up a very simple song work with those

434
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.080
Pamela: Key

435
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.830
Pamela: Things that I learned from the capital for number two.

436
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.490
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): But

437
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:15.420
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): She's saying that like the students talk a lot about what the teacher is explaining I we go really into the conversation about the topic in class.

438
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:23.070
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So when we get out of topic. I'm sorry. Talk about random things is I

439
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.910
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): For a little moment and then we come back.

440
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.450
Pamela: Up to the top.

441
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:43.470
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): And there's a lot of topics and say, oh, one which here, it's easier to understand, because like you guys did you explain one topic for time rosary you to have

442
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:50.910
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Two or more topics at once it's assigned to get a little confusing, but we talked a lot about

443
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.080
smichaels: My era.

444
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.610
smichaels: You agree with all that

445
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.290
Naiara Da Silva (Student): Okay.

446
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.120
Naiara Da Silva (Student): Thank

447
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.730
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): You for Your phone

448
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.560
Naiara Da Silva (Student): Oh, yes.

449
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.390
sue snay: We are taken out stock.

450
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:32.370
sue snay: In zoom Google me and headphones all people like me, but never use these had

451
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.730
sue snay: To use them every day.

452
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:48.270
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Around the house. So there's one in the key chain does. There's one in my room. This one is

453
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.160
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Always have

454
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:50.970
One.

455
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.540
Pamela: For

456
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.640
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): My parents have lied to us.

457
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.200
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So biggies. There's to me.

458
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.360
smichaels: Um,

459
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.860
smichaels: What what you said was interesting about

460
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.140
smichaels: Talking in Brazil, and I'm curious if it was

461
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:35.430
smichaels: If you liked participating in class here or if it was hard to participate. How do you feel about having first of all do you feel like you were expected to talk in

462
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:47.940
smichaels: Missy and necessity class. Did you feel like you were supposed to be talking and talking with you know talking out loud to others in the class.

463
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:58.860
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): I'm kind of I felt like it was something I should do with something I could do to help me understand to and help others in case I have something I'd have to sit in a given

464
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:13.980
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): But I never feel like I was obligated to do you know I was like that, that the option to give us because sometimes like sometimes you have to talk in other classes like oh you have soccer. You won't get points.

465
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.560
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Or they'll take point from you.

466
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.390
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Or sometimes we talking to her life is talking so

467
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.820
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): I like that auction things

468
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.020
smichaels: Pamela. What do you think

469
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.270

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:30.540
smichaels: How about you, in terms of this class. Did you feel like you had to participate or talk. Did you feel like you could speak up when you understand something, and wanted to share your idea or when you didn't understand something, and wanted to hear more.

491
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:39.360
Naiara Da Silva (Student): Or less even I LUCKY YOU. I SHOULD WE COME HOME TO PULL as each grade supply converse.

492
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:56.520
Naiara Da Silva (Student): airbrush for Michelle principal Moya, to be gotta we're going for my simply going to thing is a pair add to the conversation will continue to invest in San Mateo. He was, he put us bouquets much as you participate my

493
00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.460
Pamela: Thing thing.

Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So now say that she loves to participate and have those conversations like student conversation, but she doesn't talk too much because she's shy to get Ty, like a little nervous too. So, but

496
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.730
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): The little time we did for dissipate and did have

504
00:43:48.450 --> 00:44:05.490
smichaels: Guess it's. I have a question for all three of you. Do you think that talking about these ideas in class helps you learn or do you learn just as much, if you're listening. If you're listening and hearing what others say do you think talking actually helps you

505
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:17.850
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): To approved and C as in Charlie to converse as you listen. She can do materialize. Oh, size could die reversal JavaScript in the

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:53.430
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Say have conversations helps to understand more especially like when we say things and expressions that we understand like between us, so it's easier to understand, saw that

509
00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:04.740
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): That exponential like something you read a book, those difficult words, it's easier to understand. Yeah, we'll see here

510
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.500
smichaels: What do you think

511
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.860
Naiara Da Silva (Student): I think the same thing.

smichaels: Actually, one of the reasons it would be good. We're doing this in part is just to keep everybody. Yeah, keep everybody talking together talking English thinking about biology, that kind of thing. So yeah, that's good. I can understand. So I have another question.

526
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.290
smichaels: About

527
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:01.140

529
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:28.350
smichaels: Something that they are doing to see if it's helpful to have an ESL teacher, the sea and a biology teacher Miss ne working together. So I'm curious for you. What was it like to have both of the teachers, an ESL teacher and a biology teacher working together.

530
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.790
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So let's go to battle because I don't have

smichaels: ESL teacher and

556
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.670
smichaels: a math teacher or a history teacher together.

557
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:45.360

Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Say,

610
00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:04.590
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): I agree to that have conversations like between us, our table. It's better than in a big circle with the whole class.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:22.440
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Like she gets chai to get some nervous to talk in front of everyone. But on her table. She looks comfortable and sometimes when it's a big circle the whole class might get a little confusing like everyone sometimes everyone wants to talk and same time

Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Groups are better.

615
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.560

705
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.480
smichaels: Whatever. Do you feel like the small group for you was easier to talk and then the whole group.

724
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:09.360

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:52.260

750
01:06:54.750 --> 01:07:01.320
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): But like not not put everybody together like all the residents together because you've become an ass.

751
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:09.180
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Like put at least one person that will understand. Well, the other saying, and that would translate also

752

757
01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:47.640
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Um, I think the first time we've got moved

761
01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:17.640
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So I think being close always one person that we have some kind of affinity. It's good.

786
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.110

Naiara Da Silva (Student): But they hide.

793
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:05.160
smichaels: Why do you think that is

794
01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:07.110
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): But

795
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:08.760
smichaels: That the Spanish

796
01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.920
smichaels: The Spanish students talk more in, you know,

797
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.360
smichaels: When you guys

798
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:16.950
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): I think it's because

799
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:30.600
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): We're part of the class. It's Spanish they talk in Spanish and like in English, not I think in our class and our period, those non Americans.

800
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.550
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): There is

801
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.080
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): No, no, I think.

802
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:36.600
smichaels: That might be true.

803
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.470
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Yeah, so we're divided, so it's it's kind of like

804
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:53.520
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): There are more Spanish people and they are the one to talk. Most and then there's Brazilian we don't talk to my sometimes you talk. And then there are some people like they from

805
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:55.830
smichaels: Vietnam.

806
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.470
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Vietnam. They barely talk

807
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.250
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): There are the ones I think from Africa.

808
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:03.390
There's

809
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.420
sue snay: An Arabic also

810
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:11.160
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Yeah, they're spraying

811
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:14.610
sue snay: Real

812
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.560
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Yep. Yes.

813
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:18.240
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So they barely talk

814
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:21.510
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Random message because I

815
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:27.960
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): In Spanish, I understand a little bit. So they start talking about a topic and maintaining random things

816
01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.540
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): So it gets a little messy.

817
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.230
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): They talk too much, too much.

818
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:53.100
smichaels: So what would you do if you were the teacher would, would you invite all the languages in small groups and then and then try to get people to translate for each other so that we could share ideas. How, how would you, what would you do

819
01:12:54.990 --> 01:13:00.390
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): I think like, since it's for people like four per group.

820
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:02.610
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): We could put like

821
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.200
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): At least two from the same country.

822
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.510
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Like to get an amusing to Spanish

823
01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.700
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Because the Spanish, they're gonna be like

824
01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.710
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Model groups.

825
01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:22.830
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): Like divide, but still have

826
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:31.140
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): People that could talk with another with another one and send them. Yeah, so they wouldn't feel lonely or yeah

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.120
Davylle Silva De Morais (Student): This is there a

832
01:13:52.770 --> 01:14:05.790
