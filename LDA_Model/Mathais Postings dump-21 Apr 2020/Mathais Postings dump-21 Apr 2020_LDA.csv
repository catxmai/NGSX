Step 6: Analyzing a Fourth Grade Science Discussion: Student Thinking,20129 VT VINS Cohort 2,2019-08-14 15:41:00pm EDT,ChFranske,The step most illuminating to was the look at the science practices being used.

It also indicated the very clear and explicit ways that a teacher can facilitate that type of talk.  It gave examples of tools I can use.  It was helpful to see the practices and how they are so integrated with each other\, and to have another model of how they can look like in action.  Focusing in on one student was a reminder that (even if it might be easy to pass over a student&#039;s muddled and unclear explanation)\, that student has plenty to contribute\, and may need support and structures to help their voice be heard.<br /><br />The first step was most illuminating to me\, because I was struck by how clearly and obvious the teacher was in establishing and pointing the students towards discussion goals.  I want to learn from that in my own classroom.

It sounded like productive talk from the beginning\, but when we looked closer it also included lots of scientific practices\, presumably indicating a valuable discussion\, and diving into one student&#039;s turn allowed us to see that even a response which felt less clear on the surface was still indicative of a productive conversation because that student really did have a clear claim\, was using scientific practices and knew what he was talking about.<br /><br /><br /><br />I appreciated the focus on Mathais&#039;s turn because I think it can be very easy in our classrooms to skim over students who respond like this or to rush them along. (Our students do both of those things to each other as well.)

I was able to see good productive talk and what that looks and sounds like along with really focusing on the scientific practices.  I see that it can really be a nice flow between the criteria of productive talk and a flow between the eight scientific practices. Really slowing down and analyzing what a particular student said was eye opening.  I was very confused with his words but once we took a closer look it made sense.
