Here we can see evidence of students engaging in real science.  A skilled facilitator would be able to take these conversations and use them to help students continue to develop their thinking and reasoning behind the science concepts they are learning about it class.,Not implemented

It also indicated the very clear and explicit ways that a teacher can facilitate that type of talk.  It gave examples of tools I can use.  It was helpful to see the practices and how they are so integrated with each other\, and to have another model of how they can look like in action.  Focusing in on one student was a reminder that (even if it might be easy to pass over a student&#039;s muddled and unclear explanation)\, that student has plenty to contribute\, and may need support and structures to help their voice be heard.<br /><br />The first step was most illuminating to me\, because I was struck by how clearly and obvious the teacher was in establishing and pointing the students towards discussion goals.  I want to learn from that in my own classroom.  The goals were very clear through the teacher&#039;s facilitation.",Not implemented

It sounded like productive talk from the beginning\, but when we looked closer it also included lots of scientific practices\, presumably indicating a valuable discussion\, and diving into one student&#039;s turn allowed us to see that even a response which felt less clear on the surface was still indicative of a productive conversation because that student really did have a clear claim\, was using scientific practices and knew what he was talking about.<br /><br /><br /><br />I appreciated the focus on Mathais&#039;s turn because I think it can be very easy in our classrooms to skim over students who respond like this or to rush them along. (Our students do both of those things to each other as well.)  I appreciated that no one rushed him and that students were clearly still engaging with what he said rather than checking out because he sounded less clear - several students raised their hands to respond to him and the student who spoke next was clear that they were both agreeing that volume\, rather than weight was responsible.

The first showed how good discussion is established and encouraged. The second shows how many of the practices come out in small snippets and indicate a students developing understanding and proficiency in science and engineering practices.

They were demonstrating their learning orally\, which could be used as a formative assessment. There were many scientific practices used throughout this session: especially Explanation\, Asking Questions\, and Argumentation. Focusing on one student&#039;s turn was the most valuable part for me\, as this is a challenge I come upon with younger learners. I frequently have to think very\, very hard about what they are trying to say. This practice showed me that even when they seem like they might not understand\, that their actually could be understanding going on. I actually see this as an issue of equity.

All three were very helpful because they helped get to the end point of figuring out what the student&#039;s thought process was. The most illuminating was the focusing in on the student. You can assume he didn&#039;t know what he wanted to say because of all the stutters and &quot;ums&quot; but if you take those out you can see that he really knew what he wanted to say to the group. This skill will be very helpful to pay attention to as a teacher and trying to facilitate group discussions. ,Not implemented

The second step helped you see the many types of scientific practices that could occur in a single discussion.  The third step helped you to have empathy/patience for yourself and your students as you practice productive talk.  I particularly found the first step the most illuminating since it highlighted simple ways (with practice) to encourage productive discussion.,Not implemented

I was able to see good productive talk and what that looks and sounds like along with really focusing on the scientific practices.  I see that it can really be a nice flow between the criteria of productive talk and a flow between the eight scientific practices. Really slowing down and analyzing what a particular student said was eye opening.  I was very confused with his words but once we took a closer look it made sense.  I think that the most illuminating step for me was number 3 because I was thinking that he was more focused on the weight and not the volume.  This activity was very helpful.,Not implemented

Looking at the practices helped me to focus in on what I should be seeing\, scientifically\, during the discussion period. Examining one student&#039;s turn helped me to look deeply into meaning in terms of &quot;kid language&quot; and how a student might search for words but really have something valuable to say. <br /><br />Which step was the most illuminating for you?

Her language was simple\, firm\, and to the point. For example\, the teacher says\, &quot;Let&#039;s make sure everyone&#039;s looking at Mathias to show that we are listening to him.&quot; Her direct and clear statement reminds me of Lemov&#039;s moves in &quot;Teach Like a Champion.&quot; She is very clear in what students should do and reinforces an expectation of effective classroom discussion early on. When we used the &quot;Science Practices&quot; lens\, I found it fun to really find out those places where students were beginning to conduct their own investigations. What a time to celebrate as a teacher! Finally\, when we use the &quot;zoom in&quot; lens to look at Mathais&#039; talk\, I found that honoring every single student contribution is what matters most. I feel that listening to one another is one of the best gifts we can give to another person. Listening to someone can empower others to feel safe and to build confidence\, and it is through this lens that I found to be the most illuminating. ",Not implemented

I noticed both in the science learning in our own group and in this classroom that the teacher/facilitators didn&#039;t engage with or &quot;deliver&quot; content much at all.  Instead\, they structured phenomena\, questions\, and learning activities (modeling\, small group and large group discussion) and used talk moves to help students (in the video and in our class) move our thinking forward.<br /><br /><br /><br />",Not implemented

Why?<br /><br /><br /><br />These three steps helped me see more because originally\, I skipped over Mathais&#039; quote when looking for evidence of good discussion and practices\, when he in fact had a clear claim and was using evidence\, even though he was struggling to verbalize his ideas. Looking for scientific practices made me see that MANY practices tie together and can be embedded in a discussion. When at first glance\, you may think a discussion is just explaining\, at closer examination I found that there was also other practices like evaluating data\, designing an investigation\, evaluating and communicating information\, and argumentation. <br /><br /><br /><br />The most illuminating part for me was definitely looking at Mathais&#039; quote. At close examination\, it was revealed to me that he did in fact have a great claim that he supported with evidence answering the original question. This shows me that the students who struggle to communicate may still have great ideas and understand the content thoroughly\, and may be engaging just as well if not better in the practices that others. This reminds me how important it is to not judge your students\, not assume things\, and hold high expectations. ",Not implemented

The productive talk focus made me look at how the social interactions can play a part in learning\, and how important norms are.  When we looked at the video through the practices lens\, it made me look for examples of content understanding. Finally when we focused on Mathais&#039; turn\, we watched how he is practicing science by sorting ideas/concepts in his mind\, and articulating those ideas (learning). <br /><br />The most illuminating step for me was watching Mathais put it all together\, even though it was difficult to see exactly where he was going.

Focusing on the evidence of scientific practices allowed us to see that through any portion of the investigation you can see brief glimpse of multiple practices. <br /><br />3. Looking at it from just Mathais&#039;s point it was interesting to dissect what he said and to evaluate whether or not we felt he understood the concept even if some of the vocabulary or flow was disconnected. ,Not implemented

Instinctively\, I thought this to be a risky strategy that would raise the stakes of each interaction and discourage honest discussion and risk-taking.  Indeed\, if the students were not accustomed to this open talk style of class\, it may have been off-putting.  However\, the practice of directly addressing peers seems to force students to more carefully choose their words and support their counterclaims with legitimate evidence and/or reasoning.  If the discussion ran through the teacher\, then the counterclaims would still exist\, but they may not be as tactful or well-supported.
