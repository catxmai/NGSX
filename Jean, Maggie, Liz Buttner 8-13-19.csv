[00:00:04.19],Jean,"Uh BlueJeans has this wonderful ability to uh to record, so uh do you have Liz the- the set of questions in front of you?"
[00:00:15.14],Liz,"I sure do, and I took some time as I was sitting outside by the pool yesterday afternoon[laughters] to write down some of my thoughts because well first of all it's been three and a half years since I stepped out out the fray um and the period that we were reflecting on it is much more than a moment in time, in other words you know it's the adoption for Connecticut of NGSX in November 2015 was- was the culmination of many years of preliminary work so- you know I had to you know go back through my recollection of when did that start and what were the pivotal moments, so it was- it was actually a nice journey for me to take, um and especially--"
[00:01:08.00],Jean,OV:Well then you're ready to kind of dive into that first question[Liz:I-am.] adoption and- and as you said what were the challenges what were- what was the particularity of the situation in Connecticut in adopting NGSX cus I do remember this was a slog um.
[00:01:29.10],Liz,"Well you know what I think um[1.5-second-pause] I think in hindsight that the tuyeres that elapsed between NGSX publication in 2013 and Connecticut adoption in 2015 they were really essential years we were certainly not among the lead states that participated in NGSX development and as the state science leader um I knew that that could have put us at a disadvantage, we weren't in the spotlight we weren't perceived as uh one of the [air-quote]leading states um and I didn't want us to be on the backburner I didn't want Connecticut to be an after thought um, and it was that strategic thinking um and- and our MSP grant that- that led to the connection between Sarah Michaels and me, um and I think it must have been- let's see when did you roll out the very early stage of NGSX as one of the first BCSSE meetings? Am I right?"
[00:02:58.00],Jean,That's right that's- that's- when we uh Brian and Sarah and- uh I was there[Liz:OV] and we did it was part- it was that initial rollout and then I remember that was the beginning of our conversation.
[00:03:08.17],Liz,OV:I remember [indistinct] it was (BU)
[00:03:16.00],Liz,"That was the beginning of our conversation, and I'll- because [laughs]this (tongue's) kind of funny I'm gonna be blunt with you somehow I needed to get your attention[1-5.second-pause] as Connecticut represented it because there were all these other lead states science leaders who were buzzing around and I- I could sense it everbody's excitement after your presentation and you had limited slots for how many states, was it 7 maybe I remember? That you were willing to take in that first."
[00:03:52.00],Jean, Well it started out with 10 that was our but- but we took on more.
[00:03:57.29],Liz,"[laughs]We do. So I thought well how am I gonna get to the front of the line um uh so in any case that was the beginning both seeing NGSX and I think at the same conference is when Sarah did her presentation about the commnalities between common core literacy and NGSX and she did accountable talk[Jean:Right] and that was my- I didn't know Sarah before that but I was so impressed by her presentation and the videos and the teacher's talk moves so I think I approached her and said you know what teachers in Connecticut need this kind of mind expansion, and I contacted her uh to see if she'd be interested in being a partner on the MSP grant so I did a little bit of priming the pump cus MSP is a grant program is a very funky system um you know they're supposed to be competitive grants and as a competitive grant there's only so much- uh that the state can say this is what we want, so within those limitations and restrictions I reached out to her in short she said oh you know I'm so flat out busy I got all these NGSX stuff going on and I'm thinking what- what was going on and what are you doing you know and how is that working um, and that's what I think led to what turned out to be I think in your mind Jean the sort of um unique or distinctive focus that we in Connecticut wanted to take which is my higher ed science faculty really need to get- to dive into the framework the NGSX the teacher's talk moves we- we need to up the ante on how our new teachers are being trained, and right now we have this very um amorphous group of people who teach science course and I think that intrigued you Jean this whole- you know we need to take a pre-service teacher approach um as well as focusing on the in-service teachers, so we always have that 2 prongs effort and that was the NEXUS force that was the beginning, seeing NGSX meeting you and Jean and thinking I need to get my higher ed people in on this somehow, and I think- I think that got the foot in the door for us because I don't know that anybody else was either able to or was thinking along those lines at that point, this goes way back this goes back to--"
[00:07:16.15],Jean,"OV:No I- you're- you're right I think what was unique as you pointed out is this coupling of- uh partnership around the MSP grant that we eventually worked through and developed the details of, um but it was always in the forefront that teacher education wasn't the only audience wasn't the only group we were working to bring in to the experience of NGSX but it was also the classroom teacher, but you were very clear you wanted to start with the teachers at the community and that was unique there was no doubt about it."
[00:08:04.11],Liz,"Well true and with the- with the new terrain project- because of the MSP requirements you had to have partnerships between higher ed faculty and in-service teachers so it was a natural fit um it accomplished more goals than we initially um might have thought, um and maybe I should save the rest for another question cus I don't wanna you know wander all over the place but uh. Just trying to return to the- let's see to the- to the first question, um what was the education policy and budget situation when Connecticut adopted, and- and knowing that we weren't elite states knowing that at that time when NGSX was published in 2013 our state and most other states were deeply immersed in trying to implement the Common Core state standards, um we adopted Common core in 2010 um it quickly became controversial after the adoption uh it became difficult to help teachers understand what the shift in teaching's gonna be and so in our state and in many others by 2013 that was the focus there was Common core and there was no uh no interest in saying oh let's adopt more standards right now too that would be great for teachers um when you say it was a long slow slog to get to NGSX adoption, it had to be it was very deliberate we were- we were you know still birthing the baby of Common core teachers were um frustrated teachers were under pressure uh there were looming new state tests that would be based on Common core and all of a suddent teachers evaluations in hiring and firing were gonna be based on those state test scores, it was a very difficult time for teachers and for administrators because they were suddenly gonna be held very accountable for standards that they barely knew, so [laughs]the idea of adopting new science standards at that same time was really unthinkable, so the benefit of having waited 2 years was that it gave us time not to ignore it but to plan for implementation and be ready for adopting and implementing when the adoption occured, so- and I can talk more about that it's kind of hard to separate everything into-"
[00:11:06.27],Jean,"I- I know well the other- the other probably little piece is that the timing of the release of the framework and then the release of NGSX and I think we have to remember this framework came out kinda gave this large roadmap, and the particular what that roadmap might look like in terms of standards awaited this birthing uh to use your word of the NGSX document and once it came out there was great confusion how you would pull that into your classroom in some reasonable way and where was the curriculum for all this I mean all natural questions rolled out so, I think your point though is in waiting I think the framework was relat- was released in 12 these uh NGSX was realeased 13 and we began our work with you early in 15."
[00:12:24.00],Liz,No 2013 to 15 was new terrain (ASSENT) started I- I was part of the award for the (ASSENT) MSP that was my last MSP by the time you geared up I retired in early 2016.
[00:12:40.28],Jean,Exactly but I- boy thank you for correcting me so it's really 2013 that our work began and we had that initial meeting at Sacred Heart.
[00:12:53.01],Liz,"We'll always remember all of those meetings[laughters.] You know what in hindsight as I- going through it to try and bring lot of higher ed faculty and eagles together in a room united with a common purpose which had never been done before in our state and I don't know if it's been done in any state, um I- I was probably blissfully naive[laughs] maybe I knew it would be a challenge, obviously it was challenging in part because of the format of MSP grants in other words I as the state leader didn't have the permission to award a grant to anybody, I had roles to play in terms of um saying what the state wanted and I could write very rigid parameters you must know this and you must have this so I could write parameters in RFP that basically um only certain people could fit um but the award goes to Sacred Heart university and that's where the PI is housed and although it was frustrating I know to all involved, in the end there were a lot of long phone calls with- with you guys[laughs] uh with the Sacred Heart PI oh many nights and weekends um in the final analysis there was more good than harm that came out of it, and the very best part was (ASSENT) as a continuation of the network that was started by bringing together (IG) faculty. Um I want to talk more about that and maybe there's another question where I'll fit it in but I- I don't want to forget to get back to your question which actually gave me a chuckle was there a prevailing sense that teachers would need support in making these kinds of teaching shifts that we envisioned in NGSX, um and again because this was a process of many years from let's say 2012 through 2015 and beyond um our understanding of the framework and NGSX and their implications evolved over that time and continues to evolve it shifts where the emphasis is, I don't think when NGSX first came out that the focus was on phenonmenon and yet over the a year or two after it was published we said yeah explaining phenonmenon is what this really means this really means using your sciencce knowledge and practices not just for their own sake but to explain a phenonmenon that you might not have encountered before the application that took time to evolve your- that focus and emphasis on equity in science instruction yes it was there yes it was one of the epenthesese but heck we had 13 epenthesese which one do you[laughs] which one is gonna be the one you know, so I can see that over time it ebbs and flows um so um I just wanna say that no there was not a prevailing sense among the education community in our state of the enormous shift that this would mean for instruction, there's always a state of inertia in education that you know what we've been doing is pretty good and we don't need to throw out the baby with the bath water um and so no I don't think anybody realized that at first this was gonna be a very different way of teaching, we BCSSC was really an invaluable resource for us in Connecticut and I'm sure that it was for all of the states that (sent) leadership teams I mean it was really- I think it was a brillian conception on the part of all of the people that organized it and I know you were a part of it so I'm not just saying it to you know to be complimentary but it helped tremendously I think that--"
[00:17:44.00],Jean,OV:Yeah the stated needed something and um.
[00:17:50.03],Llz,"To educate us first as state leaders so we can make decisions [indistinct] efficiency oh this is what this is about you couldn't- you couldn't reach it just by reading the framework, and we were involved in early framework draft reviews I put together a team it must have been in 2011 and we- we Peter McClarin hosted it on New England frameword draft review it was confusing it was- what is this what is this vision it- it- really it was difficult to wrap one's head around. Um but in short what I want to say about this the sense of the need for teacher support is that it too evolved over time and I think it started for the state leadership team at those BCSSE conferences where we could come into contact with framework writers with NGS writers and for me that became um an ongoing theme that I wanted the educators in my state to have that same opportunity to come into contact directly with framework authors and NGSX developers cus I- I always think that you know you bring Mohammed to the mountain you know it's like I wanted them to come to the mountain not to hear it from somebody else who interpreted their way who trained somebody else who interpreted it their way, by the time yo uget to the end of the line of telephone operators you get a very different message so NGSX in my mind was the pathway to framework authors so that my teahcers in my state could hear directly from the experts from the people who conceptualized it what were we thinking what we think it look like, I thought well there's no better way and even though NGSX was still in development at the time that was a reason that I felt good about subsidizing it the continued development of NGSX uni, I thought that this is an investment in the future not just for Connecticut but for the nation cus everybody will at least have some access to it, so--"
[00:20:29.16],Jean,"That's- that's great we're counting- I- it's terrific um, I want to invite Maggie to get into this conversation cus I'm sure she might have a question or two or reach out for some clarification."
[00:20:46.10],Maggie,"I wanna ask a quick clarification question, so I attended Connecticut public schools from 2002 to 2014 and I entered highschool in 2010 um and so from a student's perspective it didn't feel- so I guess my first question is uh the CMT I don't even remember what it stands for Connecticut something test[Liz:OV:Mastery-test] but that was- Mastery test okay um so that was something that I've taken for years I didn't know what it was like to not take it um was that a product of- first part of the question was that a product of No child left behind instead of Common core or where does that come from and how did that influcence the policy and the teachers' perception of the shift to Common core and then NGSX adoption because for me entering highschool in 2010 when Common core came out I think based on yeah- um it didn't feel particularly different for me it just felt like an additional or different test that I had to take but it sounds- of course it sounds very different story on the other side on the implementation side, but I guess I'm curious about- if you could talk a little about the other side of that both the relationship of prior testing to what the change actually was and then a little bit more about how the teachers' experiences and policy experiences different from the students' experiences?"
[00:22:18.10],Liz,"That's a good question um and I'm the right person[laughs]. So a little historical context cus I- I- in my fifteen years as the state science leader I lived through 2 standards adoption with their state assessment their corresponding state assessment and any adoption of state standards is- it- it's like birthing a baby only it takes longer[laughs] so sometimes it's like cesarean section[laughs] sometimes it's a four-step delivery, it's just- it's never as easy as people think it's like oh okay we read these standards they look good to us we like them we'll adopt them but that's just the beginning of years and years of work so, to your ladder question like how come I didn't feel the change in these standards when I went into highschool it was much too early, it takes years for the standards to be disseminated through professional development so that teachers begin to understand what does this mean what are the implications of what I teach and how I teach, and then it takes years to develop a new assessment that is um representative of the vision in those standards, so you probably did not take- I don't think you took a smarter balance assessment I don't think it was ready yet um so probably you still took CAP."
[00:23:54.06],Maggie,Yes that's what it was I was trying to remember yeah I took CAP.
[00:23:57.00],Liz,You took CAP as a tenth grader[Maggie:Yes] um you took a science CAP you did a science experiment you did a performance task um and you took a--
[00:24:08.00],Maggie,Don't remember that part but I- I'm sure.
[00:24:10.00],Liz,Wait which one do you do do you remember?
[00:24:12.00],Maggie,I- I don't remember the uh the experiment part but I'm sure that you're right.
[00:24:16.01],Liz,"For some students that's only time they lay their hands on anything that even looks like science probably not for you where you went to school but when we talk about equity in science education that's an important piece to keep in mind. Um so the relationship of CMT and CAP were the state assessments that were linked to um the standards that Connecticut adopeted in 2004, so that was the first set of standards that I was involved in the development of adoption of and developing the science CMT, um so the state assessment has to be closely linked to what's in the standards um we'll always take that very seriously in our state in some states um assessment and curriculum departments are housed in different parts of the department [indistinct] you don't necessarily talk to each other they don't always have that good alignment, but I found that when you don't people will teach what's on the test hello that's as simple as it is and when I did years of professional development around the state you know as much as I wanted to raise teachers' consciousness about good instruction engaging student student discourse all the things that are important and that matter you know what there're questions at the end of the presentation that are gonna be yeah this is all great and it's interesting Liz you did a great job what's on the test can you just tell us what's on the test, you know and I would hold up our standards and I said this this is it there is no more- there's no secret, um so yes those standards from 2004 were a product of No child left behind legislation and the science CMT that was administered in 2008 so again we gave the teachers in our states 4 years between when the standards were published and when they were first tested we spent those 4 years doing professional development and curriculum alignment so that kids would have a chance to learn what's on the test, um what we learned from that is that it takes even more time than that because most distrcits as you may know don't start to pay close attention until the first test is given that's aligned with the new standards, in Connecticut that just happened this spring from my- from my keeping in touch with my buddies in the state what they tell me is many may districts the majority of districts I'd say that haven't begun to think too much about it and they're gonna wait until they get the results from their- that first assessment, um what's going on this summer is a very politically and educationally important process that's called standards setting, so they're gonna bring together committees of teachers every state will do this for their assessment, they'll look at the students' test scores they'll look at every questions and the percentages of kids that answered it right and wrong and um working as a committee they're gonna decide that basically in plain language how many questions do you need to answer correctly in order to pass the test how many questions make you proficient how many questions answered correctly make you uh advanced and those scores are what become um public knowledge and those scores are what used to evaluate and hold school districts accountable and people judge if this's a good school or bad school based on those test scores so they become very influential um the standards setting can be hugely influential um, and what I learned back in 2008 when we went through this is that if you set your standards too low and you make it a little too easy to pass the test because it would be horrible if almost everybody didn't pass the test[laughs] (heaven) then as soon as the districts get that first set of scores from the first new test if they find that 85 percent of their kids are proficient they shove the pressure off of them all professional development in science stops we're good enough we have nothing to worry about now we have to return to focusing on reading and math and that's kind of what happened in Connecticut way back in 2008, so that's why this- the standards setting committee determine that if you answer half of the questions right on this very de minimis assessment I think I can't remember how many questions there weren't many questions 39 questions something like that you got half of them right your score was proficient, and you know I kind of uh I let people know that it wasn't a secret it was a published document it's just that you had to dig for it on the state website so I would use it in my professional development to try and light a fire onto teachers and I'd say would this be okay with you in your classroom if your kids got a 50 would you say good for you we're good to go you're proficient and they'd go no that's- that's a failing grade and I said well that's where we are[laughs]. So what's going on this summer in Connecticut and in several of the other states that administered their first NGSX assessment in 2019 will also be very influential, so that's the politics and the history of it the only reason Connecticut and many other states even have a state assessment in science is thanks to NCLB, so you can say that a lot of bad things come out of NCLB but that's one of the good things that came out of it that and disaggregating the results so that you can't sweep under the carpet anymore how your students of color are doing how are your english language learners doing because before that everybody was just lumped together and it was a big secret, so those were two really good things that came of it."
[00:31:13.00],Jean,Maggie does that- does that help with your question?
[00:31:16.00],Maggie,Very much thank you. Yeah and I do wanna be mindful of time and turn it back to Jean and ask uh turn it back to [indistinct].
[00:31:24.12],Jean,Oh there's- there's a lot of terrain covered[laughters][indistinct].
[00:31:28.19],Liz,There's new terrain old terrain[laughters.]
[00:31:31.18],Jean,Old new right but this- this--
[00:31:33.05],Liz,"And you know I have to apologize in advance having lived it for 15 years and you know to become deeply- I was immersed in it, I'm not anymore but when I dive back in it's dense- it's dense there's politics there's personalities there's the federal government there's you know the state government there's parents and teachers and children it's- it is dense, so it's hard to uh separate it out but go on. "
[00:32:04.01],Jean,Liz let's go down to- let's actually get into uh NGSX as a professional learning system and um[2-second-pause] what did you- as you go back to know NGSX and what- and even in its early iteration[Liz:infancy[laughs]] infancy what did you- and then of course you stayed with the process and you went through our changes and um what do- what looking back on it what you consider to be the strengths and weaknesses of NGSX as a model of learning that connected teachers with the framework and with the NGSS and to try to give them a set of learning- adult learning experiences in which they could draw from and take back absorbed into the practice and take back into the classroom?
[00:33:09.24],Liz,"Jean you just answered your question[laughs]. Those are the- you've been doing it for so long you know the strengths very well so I will have to agree that among the strengths are- the first one I'll go back to is just being on the screen where we were blessed to have Brian and Sarah and you on site you know so that our teachers and our district science leadres could interact directly with you, but that's one of the biggest things is interacting with framework developers part of the braintrust um if you can't do it face to face then the next best thing is through video we you know Brian is talking to you uh whether he's in the room or not, um and there's just a certain um gravitas that comes along uh with hearing directly from someone who was involved in the initial work so um that's one huge factor, the other huge factor is the learning communities we meet together teachers and so it's easy to say we're eastablishing learning communities but you spend 30 horus grappling with hm um video talk performance tasks processing your own work relating that to what other teachers are doing you spend 30 intense hours together with um other teachers and the relationships that are built and the analysis the self reflection that's done is unlike anything that I've witnessed in other types of professional development, so the learning community that's established um through the combination of video and live facilitation by a highly skilled facilitator um and the shifting back and forth between what am I doing as a learner and how does- how do I put my teacher hat on and make the leap to what does that mean for me as a teacher and my designing instruction. Um the fact that you can go back and revisit through video you know like in the beginning when you first came out with this you know cyber learning was kinda a new thing you know look now I mean 9 years later 8 years later we take it all for granted but it was pioneering at the time you know Jean, um and just the idea that you could go back and replay that discussion or that presentation or that talk let me that again uh was very very helpful as a learner, um--"
[00:36:41.05],Jean,You- you're absolutely- I think for me you just hit all the right[Liz:those-were-the-biggies] those were the design biggies um.
[00:36:54.14],Liz,"Which it was really- all of those things were unique you know that direct contact with framework developer and establishing learning communities and revisiting- being able to revisit at the time, now some of what I wanna share with you now as the- how do you frame it some of the problems with it early on the weaknesses[Jean:challenges-yeah] I have to put it in the context of I recognize that when we first became involved with NGSX it really was its infancy I remember you telling me you know that you had pre-existing stuff that you saw the potential for it and you kind of packaged it together as best as you could but you- you were building the airplane as you began flying it so I get that so please you know understand that these might have been weaknesses at the time um and they may no longer be. One of the big issues that we learned early on from new terrain this was a big ah-hah was when I think I know when I went into it I thought anybody can facilitate this[laughs] um all you have to do is follow the script um and so that was what we tried do you remember when we first had the campus hub? And that was how they experienced NGSX we suffered from that."
[00:38:25.07],Jean,OV:Yeah oh that- that was an eye opener wasn't it?
[00:38:30.01],Liz,"That was a huge eye opener. I see it as a benefit I see it as a this is part of the process of you know beta testing a system and you know we thought yeah this was part of the community anybody should be able to step up and be the facilitator role but what we learned and really it affected that new terrain cohort for the next 2 years because they didn't get as much out of the NGSX experience as they might have had they had a more expert facilitator who was gonna press them who was gonna push who was gonna challenge them and question them, so they sort of sashayed through it and thought hm yeah I don't think they had the breakthrough moment that they- that we hopeed that they do today so that was a weakness at the beginning that I think we addressed. Another weakness was the bridge between the learner hat and the teacher hat, um that it was interesting to do the air pressure experiement and we got into that but we didn't always- as a result the transition let me put on my teacher hat now and think about what does that mean for me when I'm teaching about um earth system I'm not teaching about air pressure what do I extrapolate from my experience with the bottles um how does that apply to anything else, that may still be an issue with NGSX I don't know but I know that it was when we were working with ti."
[00:40:26.00],Jean,"Liz you- you touched on the solution to this earlier and that is we began to build the experience both as a learner and a teacher around the exploration of phenomena, and okay so now we have a much larger variety and a much larger suite of phenomenon that is built into pathways but even if you're not in physical science you're in earth science what can you extract from this experiement is about you would structure your classroom with phenomenon that makes sense with earth science, so that of course was part of this evolution that you talked about, and so I think the first pass the emphasis was on the re-learning that needed to take place the second emphasis was then taking that relearning into your practice and giving you ways to do that so, you're absolutely right."
[00:41:43.00],Liz,"What I noticed as I sat in on many of the NSGX sessions was extreme engagement lot of engagement but not enough transformation not enough ah-hah moments not enough oh my gosh this is gonna change everything that I do, I think they- the most impact was often from the talk moves component and I think that it was because that was very concrete and tangible and you know here you are you all university professor types and you put together something that was really whiz bang A plus but in some ways I think a lot of the messaging that you thought was clear and bold was really mudlded for teachers who were experiencing all this for the first time, I don't think that they got as much ah-hah oh this is really gonna change me as they should but- it was interesting because of the talk moves were so tangible and so specific when you read their feedback they'll always talk about that because it was something that they could hang- you know in the mind they already had a network for it and they're like okay I can use this tomorrow I know how to do that here's a list I can use that move and that move it was-, and I realize that something as complex as the framework is not easy to distill to something that is easily digestible but that's your challenge Jean[laughs]."
[00:43:36.06],Jean,"Well the other thing- it's interesting to see if you'd agree with this you know so much was being transformed in those years and one of it was the nature of professional learning, you know when we started the traditional model of set and get was still prevalent and so no one expected ah-hah moments no one expected to really dive in as a learner they were looking for the script[Liz:uh-huh-true], and it's an interesting process to write about because it takes time and it takes time for new models of professional learning to become the norm and I would say--"
[00:44:29.12],Liz,OV:It's not there yet[shakes-head].
[00:44:31.10],Jean,We're not totally there yet in states like Connecticut where we have been working in with that state you have really outstanding some outstanding districts Ellington is one.
[00:44:50.12],Liz,"Okay I think you- I think there's probably a select few when I talked to the people who're still involved their prevailing sense is that- and these are 2 more challenges for NGSX, the assurance of high quality facilitation which you know we invested in highly that's one of the initiatives and the cost you know and that brings us our affiliation and partnership with the Conneticut science center trying to operationalize NGSX and truly make it a state-wide initiative that would be accesible to all teachers and all districts for years to come I mean that was my vision, so far the cost and the time commitment we're experiencing in NGSX have been obstacles to achieving that um and what I've heard is that when we stopped using MSP grant money to subsidize district participation in NGSX study groups that enrollment went down, districts have very tight budget they always are when are they not uh things are tighter than ever and in Connecticut maybe in other states as well there's been a shift in the political thinking about allocation of education funds lots of court cases lots of legislation about equity and who needs to get the state funds and now I think the prevalent approach is to give more money to the neediest districts and consequently less money to the more affluent districts, to give less money to the more affluent districts that doesn't assure that they're gonna be doing frameworks in science [indistinct]."
[00:47:11.02],Jean,"No it- it doesn't and we should talk more about this but I do wanna make one point, it took us a while to realize that the expense that the districts were feeling had to do with some adding on that the Connecticut science center did so they were meeting their cost in ways that it reflected the reality that was not true it's just that total cost was coming from NGSX and as soon as we understood what was going on we shifted and we're now focused on districts only and I feel badly about having to- but I didn't feel badly about not understanding this cost situation was because we never got into the billing to states I mean not to states but to districts so that is something that you can keep in your back pocket, and I think our model now is to work with districts particularly districts where principals have been through (clans) through that NGSX pathway and they are believers and they want either their building or an assistant superintendant wants a number of buildings K through high school to be going through NGSX, that's the model of scaling up that I think we're working with right now in Connecticut and we have no more relationship with the science center."
[00:49:17.02],Liz,Right well the MSP grant expired also. 
[00:49:21.19],Jean,"Yeah that was part of it but um in a way we didn't- after you left we didn't deal so much with like Ron, we didn't get in we didn't have the same kind of dialogue that we had[Liz:I-know][laughters]. So um I think you know that's the way it went and I'm sorry that the reality that what the districts are being charged didn't sink in until it was probably about a year and a half but hopefully we've moved away from that and that thinking but maybe not, we would love love to get into the more urban districts in Connecticut."
[00:50:17.22],Liz,"Right that's the problem and it brings us back to what was the norm for the 15 years that I was at state was that you know the few districts that are forward thinking that wanna make a move in science or STEM education and you can certainly put this under the umbrella of STEM if you really wanna do STEM(y) and integrate mathematics with science to produce you know engineered solutions you got the perfect framework to do it and STEM is popular keep that in mind if you can pitch to the high need districts because they like STEM, but back to my point is it always troubled me greatly that there were a few districts that wanted to you know allocate funds towards it and the vast majority would not and it was usually a half versus half not and I- I railed against it and I thought no we have to find a better model so that there's equal access for everybody and that's to me that's the measure you know how many of the 112 districts in the state how many of them are experiencing this kind of high quality PDs so that their kids at least would have a fighting chance of getting excited about science."
[00:51:50.24],Jean,"Yeah you know this is another conversation but we would love to talk with you at some point about- we would be willing to you know bring someone on who is good at going into an urban district and understanding how to work with them how to gain their confidence how to help them to understand the process, and we're willing to adjust the fees we're willing to do a lot of things um but we have to have that spokesperson."
[00:52:39.16],Liz,"You know what you're verbalizing it speaks to one or the other questions in terms of you know this prevailing sense of what the teachers need, um it starts at the state it probably starts at the federal level it certainly did under NCLB NCLB made reading and math the king the king of the curriculum the king of the school day and pushed out everyone else, I would venture I woud propose that the whole STEM movement which turned into STEAM because we need arts too um was in response to saying hey hey you know what science and arts and recess and soci- they all need a place in the curriculum also you know we have to teach other things as well, so at the state level I as the science leader was always in competition with leaders who are in (English) language arts mathematics in technical education so you have this small group of the leadership on this map if you will of where the decision-making happens and where the policy happens and they're competing among themselves and there're often conversations do you think it's more important for kids to do science experiments and for them to be able to read they have to be able to read don't they, so there's some linear thinking that goes on first we have to teach them to read and then we have to teach them to do math and then maybe if there's leftover time then they can learn some science and social studies we're gonna squeeze it in one day a week, so the sense that they could learn to read and do math and calculate and write in the context of doing science or social studies or the arts is not yet embedded anywhere the sense that that's what motivates kids and excites kids you could teach them reading you could teach them decoding you could teach them how to write a decent paragraph if they're writing about the air pressure in the bottle, but that level of thinking does not permeate the system so there's always a tension between who wants to spend time on science verus reading and math are really more important and we all know that, when we go into the high need districts Maggie this gets back to your equity question this is in my mind the reason why why the very kids who could benefit in terms of careers after highschool or college that are STEM-related that requires some STEM literacy those kids that could benefit from good jobs if they stuck with a science pathway don't get exposed to it and then the science that they do get exposed to is in many ways off-putting it's a turnoff, and I had many teachers friends who taught in urban districts who knew that I was the state science leader who would say to me at the gym you know I don't do science I would turn to them and say you can't say that to me I'm the state science leader don't you know that[laughs], I don't do science and when I do how do we do it we read it out of a textbook and so oh my gosh I would make classroom observation--"
[00:56:32.20],Jean,OV:Well it's- a lot of them is so resource-driven because it's a feeling that I won't get my share of the clock and.
[00:56:41.10],Liz,"Well so in the urban districts science is most often taught as reading to kids who are poor readers now if you're a poor reader would you love science I wouldn't, so yes it's critically important that NGSX and the framework reach those kids first it has to reach those teachers and figuring out how to integrate it within the day so that none of these subject areas is (for) changed, it's a huge challenge it's a big sales pitch. I'd be happy to brainstorm with you."
[00:57:21.14],Jean,"Well Liz I know, I think we both share all three of us this passionate concern around equity in science and equity in general but if you ever run across an individual that you think would be a good fit with our group who knows those urban administrators and the urban needs in Connecticut happy to talk and see what might be possible and you know obviously a paid position so."
[00:58:01.00],Liz,"Uh huh we'll keep it in mind, it's a continuing challenge especially given what you're telling me about your current work with the select districts that want to commit to this and devote, the challenge to high quality PD is always the cost and the time the release time we face it all the time when we're gonna do it they don't want to release from the classroom they don't want to stay after school they don't wanna give up their summer we just need osmosis through your headphones on pillow at night um, but when the teachers do participate in that kind of professional development that's meaningful and transformational they love it they love it."
[00:58:47.00],Jean,"Yeah they do and sometimes it's just word of mouth, we still have a lot of activity in Connecticut and um the roots that were sown amongst some very good people, it's- it's [indistinct] and so in a sense that the scaling from one interpretation has been very successful in that there's been scaling in particular districts to where you know I think it was in Ellington when the former assistant super said I want every teacher in this district to go through NSGX, how I'd love to hear that coming out of Hartford. "
[00:59:41.26],Liz,"Maggie do you have follow up questions about the equity issue, are there specific things that you wanna discuss?"
[00:59:54.06],Maggie,Um not at the moment I do wanna be mindful of time I have to hop off relatively soon.
[01:00:03.01],Jean,"Yeah we need to wind it up, you know what maybe Liz the best way to leave this there's a lot of terrain to cover but we've taken big pieces and this's been very very very helpful, so I think Maggie and I will scrub the transcript here and see if we have holes and if you don't mind we could just hop back on again at some point."
[01:00:30.28],Liz,"I'd be happy to do that as long as- it's all in the forefront of my mind now, another idea is if it would be helpful since I did write some notes for myself that I didn't wind up referring to here but I could email you my notes if that would help."
[01:00:48.00],Jean,Oh that would be marvelous. Just send them to me and we'll put them in with all the other things we're- so and when we get a draft of the paper we'll send it to you so you can read the parts that we're drawing on now as we set the kind of context uh in Connecticut for the way in which NGSX situated itself into a statewide project.
[01:01:21.27],Liz,So just as we're wrapping up just can you talk a liitle bit more about what your hopes are for the paper for the publication what are you trying to accomplish?
[01:01:34.10],Jean," I think it's a- you know Maggie can use her own words on this but I think what we wanna tell a story about 8 states that really bought into NGSX the reasons the timing the misison of the state you know the kind of collaboration this work took on, we have data from the work that Theresa did is just basic- it's not hardcore data it's just survey data but what we do is we get an insight into the teachers and their experiences, so we're gonna kind of put that all together I don't know how exactly we're gonna end the story it maybe with just a series of questions that are still ahead of us as we think about- because NGSX has always been envisioned as a systemic professional learning model."
[01:02:56.10],Liz,Do you still have presense in other states?
[01:03:00.10],Jean,Oh yeah right now on top of my head we've been in 19 states Liz and we've had over 9000 participants through the study group process so we're- I'd be neat to show you kind of where we are- hey you should get on our website sometime and uh take a look at- just go to ngsx dot org and it'll take you there.
[01:03:40.19],Liz,I don't feel like we've spoke very much about you know the state ed department relationship with the science center and why we did it um if you wanna know just a little bit of the background I know now is not the right time but I can put that in the email to you as well.
[01:04:01.27],Magige,That'd be very helpful and that would be one of the things that we wanna follow up on.
[01:04:05.04],Liz,Cus that was unique um.
[01:04:07.02],Jean,"It was very unique and it got out this- our vision to not work with individual teachers or individual districts but with the system and that is required in order to make the kind of change at the level we've all been talking about here, and um you know in the latter years we missed you a great deal there's no getting around it."
[01:04:38.01],Liz,"Thank you that makes me feel very honored. I try- when I retired I tried to do as much as I could to leave an infrastructure that would carry on without my being there NGSX was part of that we have the online learning modules that Nick and the science center developed it's free access so there were things that I knew I needed to put in place just in case nobody was pushing[laughs] after I left, but that seems to be you know kind of where the state is there in the you know not in the business of helping districts so much anymore so[Jean:No-no] we were fortunate to be there at the time when it was a priority so Maggie I'm mindful that you have to run Jean I will send you a follow up well I will send a follow up to both of you I have your email addresses, and if you wanna chat again online I always enjoy your company."
[01:05:44.17],all,[saying-goodbye]
