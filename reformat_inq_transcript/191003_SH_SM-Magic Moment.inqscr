text=[00:00:12.26];Jess; Bismark could you read question number 2, nice and loud for us? [Bismark proceeds to read]. Hold on, I am sorry Bismark, there's a lot of conversation going on over here, we're gonna listen while Bismark reads question 2, he's going to be the voice we're going to be listening to right now \r[00:00:27.19];Sue;Use your lungs! Project!\r[00:00:30.03];Bismark;What is the normal rate of extinction?\r[00:00:34.02];Sue;So the normal? Normal, rate, so we're gonna go back to the article?\r[00:00:40.23];Jess;Let's go back out here. Okay, I am gonna, it's gonna be in this paragraph here.\r[00:00:53.29];Sue;May not be worded exactly the same as that. The normal rate. \r[00:00:59.29];Jess; What is another word for normal? If you're kind of right in the middle and it's normal \r[00:01:01.20];Bismark; (inaudible) [check audio file]\r[00:01:08.15];Jess;Oh strange, are strange and normal \r[00:01:10.16];Bismark;Not stange, straight \r[00:01:10.16];Jess;Oh okay, straight. Okay, I am sorry I thought you said strange and I am just like oh! So normal, you're not too strange it's not too strange, it's not too\r[00:01:22.16];Sue;What about in Math class? [Jess:Yeah], when we think about, the norm. What's another name for that? [2 second pause] Maybe you're asking, yup\r[00:01:33.18];Azani;The average \r[00:01:35.22];Sue;The average! So you might want to look for that, okay so anything, anyone find, in this paragraph right here, anything about average? [students don't repond for 3 seconds] we said the normal rate in the question but Azani said that average is another word for average, so can we find anything about the average rate? \r[00:02:01.08];Edilin;Oh I found it\r[00:02:03.28];Jess;Oh so Davylle had her hand up and edilin had her hand up \r[00:02:06.15];Sue;You wanna go underline it?\r[00:02:06.15];Edilin;Sure \r[00:02:10.02];Sue;You guys got a lot of energy in there I like it\r[00:02:11.24];Edilin;Wait I think I lost it \r[00:02:13.22];Sue;No you'll find it again [laughs] So we're looking for the normal extinction rate\r[00:02:28.26];Edilin;[Points to the board] oh right here the average [underlines the line on the board]\r[00:02:34.10];Sue;Alright\r[00:02:35.00];Jess;That's great\r[00:02:38.05];Sue;So do you agree with that? Oh Sana has something else to add\r[00:02:41.27];Edilin; Oh here you go [passes the marker to Sana]\r[00:02:45.12];Sana;I think this one [underlines a different sentence on the board]\r[00:02:49.17];Sue;Oh so there's a little bit more, we're not sure if, if which of those is the extinction rate, so, so what do we all think? Average extinction rate of less than two speicies per million years, and then Sana underlined in the past 500 years a minimum of 80 of 5570 species of mamal have gone extinct.So what do you think about that? Can you turn to the person next to you, turn to the person next to you right now, Felipe, turn to the person next to you right now, which of those sentences or numbers do we think is the normal rate of extinction. Turn to the person right now and discuss that, so right next to you, which one of these two?\r[00:03:52.04];Jess; Which one's the normal rate?\r[00:03:54.26];Sue;So we wanna know if this is the normal rate or if this is the normal rate? There two sets of numbers are there\r[00:04:02.17];Jess;Which one do you think? Which one is it?\r[00:04:06.28];all[pair talk];\r[00:04:58.27];Sue;Did everybody get the chance to talk to the person next to them?\r[00:05:03.13];Jess;I think there was some talking\r[00:05:04.26];Sue;Alright these guys did too, right over here \r[00:05:09.09];All; [Continued talk from class]\r[00:05:13.10];Sue;Alright, can't wake these kids up today\r[00:05:17.03];Jess;Alright so with these pieces of information, one talks about the average rate, other talks about a change in the past 500 years. So, which one represents the average rate, as it has always been [Sue:Always], always been for a long time, was it less than 2 speicies per million or 80 of 5570 species of mammals\r[00:05:44.11];Arlenys;Two speicies per million years \r[00:05:46.16];Sue;Two Speicies, per, million, years. So what's happening right now? \r[00:05:53.18];Arlenys;We're almost die..\r[00:05:54.05];Jess; Oh I am sorry\r[00:05:54.05];Sue;Oh that's okay \r[00:06:04.10];Sue;Oh you're almost, yeah there you go, you're good.What- what actually happening right now? In the past\r[00:06:12.10];Edilin;500 years\r[00:06:13.14];Sue;500 years, we've had a minimum or 80 mammal go extinct, just in 500 years, is that the normal?\r[00:06:25.19];?;No miss\r[00:06:27.27];Sue;No alright so\r[00:06:28.06];Jess;So it's alot of higher than the normal. Alright so the normal rate of extinction is, what do you say? [2 seconds pause] What do we say? \r[00:06:40.01];Sue;Tell Mrs.Z what to type\r[00:06:42.00];Edilin?; 2 species\r[00:06:42.22];Jess; 2 species, \r[00:06:45.25];Arlenys;per million\r[00:06:45.25];Jess; Per what?\r[00:06:47.10];Arlenys; million \r[00:06:48.04];Jess; Per million \r[00:06:49.27];Arlenys; years\r[00:06:49.27];Jess;Years, awesome, thank you. Two species per million years. We're not gonna, we're not answering these in complete sentences but that's okay, that's okay for right now, Two speciies per million years, that's the normal rate. That's not a lot, but it's increasing\r
