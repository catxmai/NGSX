[00:01:53.02],Renee," [appears] Yep.  [shuffling, puts in earbuds, reading/texting]"
[00:05:21.28],DeAnn," [voice icon appears] [sigh, 9-second pause, video appears]"
[00:05:32.28],DeAnn," Hello, can you hear me?  [6-second pause] Maybe?"
[00:05:44.27],Renee," [begins talking, but is still muted]"
[00:05:45.21],DeAnn, [sigh] can't hear you
[00:05:47.00],Renee, Sorry I can hear you I-I-ah
[00:05:49.13],DeAnn," I can hear me now, "
[00:05:49.21],Renee, Can you hear me now? I was- 
[00:05:49.07],DeAnn," Yes,"
[00:05:52.10],Renee, I was muted there for a second sorry
[00:05:54.22],DeAnn," By the way you were just staring at the screen I had the screen off I'm like aw she's all by herself, [chuckles]"
[00:05:59.24],Renee, [laughs] That's very sweet of you thank you. [chuckles]
[00:06:03.14],DeAnn," Good. Oh, my my."
[00:06:08.26],Renee," Are you at-are you at home, away from school now?"
[00:06:12.06],DeAnn, Yes.
[00:06:14.06],Renee, [indistinct]
[00:06:14.14],DeAnn," Yes I'm hiding in the spare bedroom, which "
[00:06:16.25],Renee," I know, right that's (how I fe-)"
[00:06:17.03],DeAnn, there's too many kids out there and husband [chuckles] Yeah
[00:06:19.22],Renee, [chuckles] I know.  I had to shut the door.
[00:06:24.28],DeAnn," Cause I turned and my husband turns the TV up so loud it's, [Renee chuckles] it's crazy.  [6-second pause] I guess I'm wa-I'm alm-finished almost all-I'm done with Lesson 3 in (redefinish) everybody's way ahead of me."
[00:06:44.00],Renee," I don't think so, I don't know where, Laura is, she may be, around there too let's see [3-second pause]"
[00:06:56.16],DeAnn," I just know, we had a lot of interruptions you know "
[00:07:01.27],Renee, yeah
[00:07:02.01],DeAnn," the NWEA testings, and of course they like to do it during science cause you know that's not as important as math or language arts"
[00:07:11.21],Renee," Ha, right."
[00:07:13.08],DeAnn, [chuckles]  Same with picture day.
[00:07:17.28],Renee, Ah right
[00:07:18.04],DeAnn, kids do it during science classes (that) you know they don't need their time.
[00:07:25.01],Renee, Right
[00:07:26.16],DeAnn, (phew)
[00:07:27.25],Renee," We'll have to ask where Laura is cause I was-in her class last week and, she was, just finish-just starting lesson 2, uh,"
[00:07:40.00],DeAnn," Oh, okay."
[00:07:40.14],Renee," That was at the end of (last week) so she might be at, 4 or 5 you know, um, so, uh"
[00:07:50.01],DeAnn, [indistinct]
[00:07:49.07],Renee, no worries so-so you're on to f-four you said?
[00:07:53.21],DeAnn, Not yet but I will be
[00:07:56.11],Renee, Yeah
[00:07:56.19],DeAnn, within a day
[00:07:57.25],Renee, Yeah.  (That's good) all right I gotta grab one thing hold on a second
[00:08:02.12],DeAnn," Go ahead. [yawns, Renee goes to bookcase and returns]"
[00:08:16.24],Michael, [appears]
[00:08:20.06],Michael," Hi Renee, hi DeAnn"
[00:08:22.25],DeAnn," Hello [2-second pause, Renee does not have earphones]"
[00:08:26.18],Michael," Renee sorry I didn't get on earlier I had a-believe it or not another, meeting, [Renee puts in earphones, DeAnn chuckles] Hi."
[00:08:35.24],Renee, Hi!
[00:08:37.12],Michael," Sorry I didn't get on earlier, I had another meeting believe it or not."
[00:08:41.02],Renee," I have n-I, doesn't surprise me at all, and you taught all day at u-at uh-in-at the Connecticut Science Center how'd it go it sounds like it was great,"
[00:08:50.19],Michael," Yeah, that's-I got a groupie "
[00:08:53.29],Renee," You totally have a groupie she was texting me all day and I was like,"
[00:08:57.08],Jamie, [appears] [indistinct] (on)
[00:08:58.16],Renee," I was like, [makes face] oh she's got headphones. I was like don't tell me tell him"
[00:09:06.03],Michael, Hi Jamie
[00:09:07.29],Jamie, Hi! [rubs hands together]
[00:09:13.08],Renee," oh look she's ready [chuckles, repeats motion]"
[00:09:16.18],Jamie," No, we [indistinct]"
[00:09:16.08],Michael, I know she's (got) so much to talk about
[00:09:18.10],Jamie," We did lesson six today, and my kids were like [makes face] Miss Noll, you have to drop the mic like, when we did the-like amplitude, drop the mic"
[00:09:29.16],Renee, [chuckles]
[00:09:29.22],Jamie, so I like literally took like SmartBoard pen and like dropped it and they were like yeah [all chuckle]
[00:09:35.22],Renee, [chuckling] that's awesome [2.5-second pause]
[00:09:39.19],Michael," Even in your tough classes, Jamie?"
[00:09:43.28],Jamie," You know, it was-really, uh-tough in those classes, and like, you could just see it was heavy for them, thinking about it, but I feel like they felt like, at the end, you were there-like they-all got there, um, it was more enjoyable"
[00:10:06.22],Renee, Does at the end-end-of-end of lesson 6 just the amplitude part of lesson 6 is that what is was?
[00:10:12.19],Jamie, Yeah we did the-the amplitude and then the start of frequenc-like
[00:10:16.13],Renee," Yeah, yeah"
[00:10:16.27],Jamie, recognizing the amplitude change but the frequency didn't
[00:10:21.18],Renee, Didn't.  Huge
[00:10:22.21],Jamie," Um, huge! I had to do a little bit more like [gesturing] come on, pulling of them I felt, like there was more, my kids were not like oh I wanna go up and measure it, [all laugh] some of them did,"
[00:10:40.09],Renee, Right [chuckles]
[00:10:40.17],Jamie," some of them did,"
[00:10:42.04],Renee, (be) like don't you wanna measure it?
[00:10:42.12],Michael," Oh, can I-can I have a ruler, pleeease [laughs]"
[00:10:47.16],Renee, yeah
[00:10:47.24],Jamie, I was like look at i-look at this meter stick could we use this [chuckling]
[00:10:52.19],Michael, Sure
[00:10:53.19],Renee, right [chuckling] oh yeah
[00:10:54.09],Jamie, In a much better place than the last time I saw you Michael [chuckling]
[00:11:00.22],Michael," Oh good, good"
[00:11:03.01],Jamie," How are you guys, hi DeAnn"
[00:11:03.24],Michael, Yeah you had tons of-you had a ton of testing huh
[00:11:06.04],DeAnn, Hello
[00:11:07.15],Michael, Bummer
[00:11:08.18],DeAnn, Oh yep
[00:11:08.27],Jamie, A ton of testing? [indistinct]
[00:11:11.27],DeAnn," The NWA, they do it during science because you know, language arts and math are important. [rolls eyes]"
[00:11:24.03],Jamie, Yeah.
[00:11:26.05],Renee?, [indistinct]
[00:11:26.04],Jamie, It's-it's-it take
[00:11:27.21],Michael, (Does)
[00:11:28.04],Jamie, I-I'm gonna be luck-I'm gonna m-hit right up to winter break I think.
[00:11:34.14],Renee, You're not gonna be alone in that.
[00:11:37.00],Jamie, Okay.
[00:11:37.08],Renee," I don't think.  Although I don't kn-uh-we were talking the other day Michael and I like Bend 2 does go f-w-will likely go faster than Bend 1, right, "
[00:11:49.08],Jamie, Yeah
[00:11:49.18],Michael, [indistinct]
[00:11:49.29],Renee," There's a lot that's happening in Bend 1 to develop these a-amplitude and frequency and to-connect it back and, um, b-right a-a-and I mean Day 1 u-lesson 1 is like three or four le-you know so I-I think there's bend 2 is tends to be a little faster"
[00:12:06.11],Jamie, (Yeah)
[00:12:05.21],Renee, (Is that [indistinct])
[00:12:05.27],Michael, [indistinct]
[00:12:07.03],Jamie," I mapped it out (based on a front matter,)"
[00:12:08.27],Michael," We've t-we've trimmed one-one day off of uh, the first lesson in bend 3 though so,"
[00:12:15.22],Jamie, Okay
[00:12:15.28],Michael," so some of where we need to defe-you know, put more in that start we're finding we can speed things up later so,"
[00:12:23.04],Renee, [indistinct]
[00:12:23.12],Michael," it's possible, it may not just get longer and longer which I know we, did-on lesson 7 "
[00:12:28.08],Jamie, Yeah.
[00:12:29.23],Renee," [chuckles] Yeah, that's-that's a strategy.  Oh there's Misty"
[00:12:35.15],Jamie, Yeah
[00:12:36.11],Misty, Hey
[00:12:38.13],Michael, Hey Misty
[00:12:39.05],Jamie, Hi Misty
[00:12:41.04],Michael, Hey Trey
[00:12:43.05],Trey," [waves, begins speaking but is muted]"
[00:12:43.27],Renee, Hi Trey
[00:12:46.14],Trey, Hey everybody.  I'll be on in the background in case anybody has questions.
[00:12:49.24],Jamie, Can I ask you a question Trey?
[00:12:49.26],Renee, Okay [chuckles]
[00:12:51.26],Trey, Sure
[00:12:52.29],Jamie," I-I talked to people in the district and apparently, my guy was talking to your guy your guy being Brian, um, do I have-can I collect data yet, can I, send you guys stuff,"
[00:13:07.10],Trey," Uh, as far as I know and Michael you can correct me, I still don't think we have final approval, to receive stuff I mean you can keep, doing what you're doing"
[00:13:17.19],Jamie, I'm collecting-
[00:13:17.07],Trey, keep
[00:13:18.02],Jamie, I'm collecting everything.
[00:13:19.14],Trey," Sure as-as long as it's useful for you and you feel like, you can learn stuff from it then that's cool we just can't look at it. Ourselves."
[00:13:27.27],Jamie," Okay, right"
[00:13:27.09],Trey, Well and if you-if you
[00:13:28.13],Jamie, If I get approval can I send you stuff from before?
[00:13:31.10],Trey, [nodding]
[00:13:32.27],Jamie, Okay [thumbs up]
[00:13:32.01],Trey, uh yes
[00:13:32.27],Michael, I think-so
[00:13:34.14],Trey, Yes
[00:13:34.24],Michael," That's what I used to-do I'd be like well I shouldn't sha-I was bad as a teacher, [laughs] Like I didn't-IRB shmIRB now that I'm on the other side I'm gonna [cutting off gesture]"
[00:13:46.28],all, [scattered chuckles]
[00:13:48.28],Renee, Hi [indistinct]
[00:13:48.08],Trey," I mean-I mean there's this-there's this tension right cause you want-e-every kid to experience the curriculum you want it to go w-you know, you're doing this no matter what whether we can, study the student work or not so, um, yeah just-as long as it's not interfering with your teaching like you know and you're willing to collect some stuff, and then you feel like you can share with us later, then that's great. [Jamie gives an A-Okay sign, 8-second pause]"
[00:14:15.25],Michael, I think the gang is all here
[00:14:19.00],Renee," Uh we're missing Wanda,"
[00:14:21.01],Michael, Oh [indistinct]
[00:14:21.09],DeAnn, Yeah where's Wanda
[00:14:23.13],Renee," We'll get-we-it's only 5:29 so we can give her another,"
[00:14:27.00],Gerard, (oh no okay)
[00:14:27.15],Laura, [chuckles]
[00:14:29.06],Gerard, 4:29 here
[00:14:28.08],Renee," Michael,"
[00:14:31.01],Renee, Oh [indistinct]
[00:14:30.24],Misty," I know I was like 5:29, [chuckles]"
[00:14:33.24],Michael," Wanda posted, I saw her posting"
[00:14:35.27],Renee," Yeah she posted-yeah every time I-I we do our little agenda we sort of time things out, I do east coast time and sometimes Michael goes back in and changes it to-to central time [scattered chuckles]"
[00:14:47.18],Misty, To confuse you more
[00:14:48.24],Renee, [indistinct] Just to mess with me
[00:14:51.14],Michael," No, it's just it's-all about me, [chuckles]"
[00:14:54.21],Renee, Right well that too. [6-second pause]
[00:15:00.19],Michael," Maybe uh, j-is everyone on, they can-take a peek at some of people's postings, [4-second pause] Oh and we're on session 3. [nodding]"
[00:15:12.09],Renee," Session 3. [53-second pause, background noise/shuffling as people read]"
[00:16:05.21],NGSX, Recording is On
[00:16:06.10],Wanda," I'm in a meeting, Al.  Did you take my headphones?"
[00:16:10.19],Al? [man offscreen for Wanda], I didn't-yeah
[00:16:11.21],Wanda, Yeah
[00:16:12.00],Al? [man offscreen for Wanda], I thought they were (over on the sofa or something) 
[00:16:13.29],Renee?, [chuckles]
[00:16:13.28],Wanda, No.  Hello.
[00:16:17.13],Michael, [waves] hey Wanda.
[00:16:19.15],Renee, Hi Wanda!
[00:16:22.06],Wanda, I'm at a meeting.  My kids [shaking head]  Hello everybody.
[00:16:26.29],Michael, Hello.
[00:16:28.24],Misty?, Hel-hello
[00:16:30.09],Jamie, Hi
[00:16:31.09],Gerard, Hello
[00:16:31.23],Jamie," [interference] [talking to someone offscreen, gives thumbs up] how are you."
[00:16:36.28],Wanda, Oh. [interference]
[00:16:39.00],Renee, All right.  Or are-DeAnn-said she stepped away
[00:16:42.11],Wanda, Can you hear me?
[00:16:44.07],Renee, for a second
[00:16:45.10],Renee, Hey everyone
[00:16:46.21],Laura?, Hi
[00:16:47.21],Misty, Hi!
[00:16:48.29],Renee, Thanks fo-thanks everyone
[00:16:49.07],Wanda, [indistinct]
[00:16:52.05],Renee," for-for posting, it's always helpful to be able to look at those ahead of time,"
[00:16:55.18],Misty, Mm-hmm. [3-second pause]
[00:17:00.01],Renee," Uhh-all right I can't-last time I had two screens,"
[00:17:04.06],Michael, I th-
[00:17:06.09],Renee," but-so now I only have one, um- so we'll just give you the sort of similar situation this-tonight we'll do a little troubleshooting, we'll get to hear about some cool stuff you're doing, um we're gonna focus around, the question of, um, how do we help-how do (we aware) students to motivate the next steps, right next steps in investigation so that's what we asked you to post about so we'll talk about that in step 2, um, and, we'll continue that in steps 3 and 4 where we're gonna think a little about, um, some of the talk moves and strategic moves that we can make to help spread ideas around the group so more kids are involved um and that goes with any of the questions and then in the last step where we'll spend the bulk of our time we're gonna-, look at bend 2 sort of looking ahead looking forward and thinking about how we can help motivate from one lesson to the ot-to the-to the next.  And thinking about what we can be thinking about as teachers so, that's sort of the plan for tonight and we'll start with um, troubleshooting (to) see if there's anything that came up it looks like there were-, two things that came up one, u-um was this idea about, the model trackers feeling a little sticky, Laura, for you"
[00:18:20.17],Michael, Yeah
[00:18:20.25],Laura, Yeah
[00:18:21.22],Renee," [nods] (so) we-we could talk about that and then there was a question about, student engagement.  Let's start with-let's start with Laura the tracker question Laura you wanna tell-s-say a little bit more about that?"
[00:18:33.00],Laura," So I'm finding is um, we have our scientist meetings, they're doing great we can model, they can understand but when I say to them, we get the tracker out and I'm like okay so what are the-things that we've learned they're-I don't know if it's the format of the tracker or the, um, they-they just freeze they just freeze and are like I don't know what you want me to do I don't know, what we figured out I mean,"
[00:19:04.11],Michael, [chuckles]
[00:19:04.17],Laura, i-I was modeling it for them in the beginning like I-I was helping them let's talk about it let's figure out what goes in here together and then as soon as I set them loose in teh realm they just sort of stare at me
[00:19:15.11],Gerard?, Oh wow
[00:19:15.11],Laura," Um-but they can talk about it and they totally get what they're supposed to be doing and what they've learned, and I don't know what it is about that document that's freezing them up."
[00:19:24.08],Wanda?, [background chatter from others]
[00:19:23.25],Renee, Yeah.  So-so-
[00:19:29.06],Laura," I think it looks really official,"
[00:19:29.16],Michael, So of a-
[00:19:30.17],Laura, and they feel like they need really official language?  
[00:19:33.25],Renee, Yeah
[00:19:34.06],Laura," And-and-and they don't know-if-they don't wanna be wrong, I-I don't know what it is. [2.5-second pause]"
[00:19:40.18],Michael," Have others encountered that the-the-similar issues around the model track or just feels, too formal or, it feels contrived or, it's just hard to"
[00:19:52.12],Misty," I think what I've decided that it does so like I'll experience is similar to what you're saying is that when we're talking they'll come up with ideas they have things that they wanna say, and then when we go to write it in the tracker and I don't know if it's just because of the way in which, it's being done right like so it's not, on my chart paper it's in this like googley docy-type thing that I'm typing in and so I don't know if, they feel like, if that's the structure of that that makes them hesitant or wanna say something and so that might just be in, the way that I presented it cause I think they see it as like notes almost because I heard somebody refer to it as they were like oh I didn't get the notes from yesterday and I was like notes from yesterday like, what are you talking about like I didn't know what they were talking about cause I was like notes what notes and they were like, from yesterday and I was like can you show me what you're talking about and they like brought the paper over and I was like, oh-oh those aren't notes like that's just what we figured out like when we finished the lesson and they were like, but I don't have the notes, like I think they think that like everybody's is supposed to be the same like we should all have the same information, and I think that might be where the hesitation is coming from, not like they don't know what to put there cause yeah these are things that they just told me "
[00:21:08.29],Laura, Yeah [chuckles]
[00:21:09.22],Misty," and I'm like all right so what do we-you know like and we're like-typing it someone's saying it I'm just typing it up there you know cause , even the-the language won't be exactly what's like on the-the teacher document version of it, um that I like look at to be like okay what are we supposed to be writing about you know like in my head I'm like I wanna make sure we're talking about those things, um, but I feel like, it's just-I think that's my fault because of like I'm like all right let's pull these out and they are like, okay I need to make sure I write what you have in yours and they haven't, I don't think they own it as like their document yet, and it might jus-it's prob-I'm taking the fault because like that's how we've been doing it you know like and so like for them it's like all right we're done we need to like get the notes from this section like what we learned you know like let's write that down but they think it should be like the same."
[00:21:57.04],Laura, [nodding] yeah
[00:21:57.11],Michael, Hmm.
[00:22:00.01],Renee," So what are some other ways that-cause last time we talked about other ways to-that people ideas had-t-other ways that people were sort of keeping track of the ideas besides the tracker, that would make it more accessible, has anybody tried anything like Post-It notes or just like a big piece of chart paper where you're just keeping track of the principles or like is-it-because-you don't want them to feel like they're taking notes."
[00:22:22.27],Laura, That's what I
[00:22:23.05],Misty, Right!
[00:22:23.29],Laura," think I'm gonna go to next, yeah I wanna make just a big poster every day like all right what did we come up with today and what do we wanna walk away with and I'm just gonna stick it on the wall with the nine thousand other things on my wall, and we'll see where we go from there.  [nodding]"
[00:22:37.18],Misty, Yeah.
[00:22:39.27],Renee," I-yeah I mean-and maybe they first, do some thinking in their notebooks?  Before they-so that they have stuff to contribute to that discussion or whatever and then they won't feel like it's so formal I don't know"
[00:22:47.21],Laura," Well usually we just come up in conversation we often pu-we do that we often end almost every day with a big conversation, so I'm thinking you know we could then at the end of the conversation, almost like the model tracker, I think-I think it's the google doc that"
[00:23:02.26],Renee, Yeah
[00:23:03.06],Laura," freaks them out, um, and just do it-all right so tell me what did we walk away with today what do we know.  And try that."
[00:23:09.15],Jamie," I um, there's usually I-I know you're one to one I think Laura like they, um,"
[00:23:16.12],Laura, Yup.
[00:23:16.18],Jamie," like-and-if you're printing the packets there's like usually a big empty space somewhere, and so I've been having them like write down, like, each person like write down like one important thing, like a small piece of what we  learned today, that they could share, and then sharing with their group, and then having the group-then call-doing the like okay, Carly I-can you get us started and then Carly gets us started and then Carly picks the next person, and then we just kinda add on like and then like-today I like-we did like the amplitude and frequency and so I started out the sentence on my (track) with the amplitude, and they t-they, as a class told me the rest of what to write and it do-I mean like-it is a little (feeling contrived) and I was like okay so like wait what do we know about amplitude and volume and then they, and I'm putting it in, their words I also-I teach six sections, so I kind of play dumb sometimes, I'm like wait what was that word that you guys have been using that was different from last class, and like have them-so they really feel like it's their class's, words that I'm putting in there.  But it's-still (essentially) what-we wanted, you know within the-key anyways.  I don't know if that helps."
[00:24:36.02],Renee, Go ahead Gerard.
[00:24:36.26],Gerard," Okay um, [clears throat] I'm glad you guys brought this up in conversation because um, w-I just had a conversation with my colleagues today and we were like, why can't students remember, things, like why don't things transfer from one day to the next, or from one week to the next, and I just thought of an idea um, what i-cause I think you guys are asking us for how can we you know find more innovative ways to improve this unit and-I'm wondering if it would engage students more if it was more like a comic strip, to where-um there were-it was a little more graphic to go along with just writing text because, I agree that the format itself looks kinda boring, so-another idea too is to maybe have-like pairs of students be responsible for just being the ones that, summarize what we learn each day, and then-start off the next lesson by checking in with all right, what did we add to what we learned yesterday.  You see what I'm saying?"
[00:25:44.05],Laura?, Mm-hmm
[00:25:45.15],Renee, Yeah.
[00:25:47.03],Michael," Are y-Gerard are you sort of saying like, we-it's almost like the incremental model tracker could be passed around to group members or something,"
[00:25:55.03],Gerard," Um,"
[00:25:56.08],Micahel," There could be like a-a group, (document)"
[00:25:57.02],Gerard," well there could be a shared docu-it could be a shared document but instead of um, just making it part of the routine where we say all right what did we learn today, you can have like kids take turns in pairs being the ones responsible for that, so that each-you know it's just-I don't know I was just thinking that that's something that could be-um, to spice it up a little bit, like kids can look forward to being the ones to-to um, summarize for the whole class but make it more of a, I don't know some kind of graphic format, [3-second pause]"
[00:26:31.28],Jamie," Table 8 you're in charge of coming up with today's, tracker, comic. [indistinct]"
[00:26:39.21],Gerard," Yeah or it can even be a-a home fun assignment you know a,"
[00:26:44.03],Jamie," Oh I like that,"
[00:26:44.24],Michael," Ja-Jamie can I riff off that though for a second like, a-a-you've got me thinking of another idea"
[00:26:50.25],Jamie, Yeah
[00:26:51.05],Michael," so what if one group is like y-everyone talks through it, right so like what would we put in here and then we pick a group to like, to put-they put their ideas in or probabl-like you said group 8 and the rest of the class is like are we good with that?  Does that represent all of our, joint thinking is there anything that like you wanna like modify,"
[00:27:10.25],Jamie, Mm-hmm
[00:27:11.01],Michael," Maybe it'll feel less formal, which was I think, Laura's, original, point."
[00:27:17.20],Renee," And Michael the point-and I think-like-if you were to say like or what-what would everyone say is the point of, in, of the tracker.  Like what's the purpose?"
[00:27:28.17],Wanda," (Summarize,) isn't it to summarize what they've learned."
[00:27:32.23],Renee," Like what, what-what we've figured out so far right, like where are we with this thing right [chorus of agreement/mmms]"
[00:27:37.12],Renee," so, it seems like there could be multiple visual ways to do that, if the tracker is feeling not, as, right and so-cause Laura you're saying like they're-they're pumped they're talking about it, they're figuring it out and then they're going to put it in the thing and it's like womp womp, right "
[00:27:53.13],Michael, [laughs]
[00:27:53.21],Renee," so other ways, [others chuckle]"
[00:27:55.08],Laura," I mean-you've been in my class, we are not terrible formal, so"
[00:27:59.23],Renee, They're not terribly formal?
[00:27:59.23],Laura," So,"
[00:28:00.23],Renee, and they are
[00:28:02.03],Laura, they are not formal
[00:28:02.09],Renee, definitely excited
[00:28:03.01],Laura, they're very excited
[00:28:04.18],Renee, they are-yup 
[00:28:04.20],Laura, and they-it-it almost I said as soon as I pull that thing up it's like the whole thing does go [noise effect]
[00:28:10.25],Renee, yeah
[00:28:11.29],Laura, So I-we just need another way. [chuckles]
[00:28:14.02],Renee, Well and the thing is-again what's on there is that there's no magic to it right
[00:28:18.27],Laura, right
[00:28:19.07],Renee," it's like what have we figured out it's like what is this thing and what have we figured out from it, so to me if-if that format is shutting them down then [shakes head]"
[00:28:26.00],Laura, Yeah I think I'm just gonna go big pieces of paper.
[00:28:27.12],Renee," Abort the mission yeah, yeah."
[00:28:29.19],Laura, Mm-hmm.
[00:28:31.11],Renee, So then we had another
[00:28:31.19],Michael, Yeah
[00:28:33.11],Renee," troubleshooting-um comment about, uh engagement Jamie do you wanna say something, about that"
[00:28:40.04],Jamie," Yeah I mean I guess-it-it's-it's interesting cause like I had my yellow-I had three classes that are yellow that I had today and they're like way, like I go home on yellow days and I'm like [makes uplifting gesture] and then I go home on blue days and I'm like Ahh [clutches head] um, and I just-I-I don't think it's an issue of like, high kids versus low kids but-just some kids that are just like, not into school, not into science, they don't quite like, just kinda like, in la la land and like, they're not-they're not diriving whereas like, half my classes I would say the kids like they get it, we're asking the questions, we're like-doing these investigations that we thought of on the first day, it's getting better I think but, um, I just have those couple of kids that are like just, dragging-dragging their feet.  Um. [3.5-second pause]"
[00:29:35.08],Gerard, Can I share something
[00:29:36.16],Michael, Please-yeah
[00:29:36.29],Jamie, Yeah
[00:29:38.16],Michael, I was gonna say let's put it out to the group and-get some ideas
[00:29:40.21],Gerard," Um, well o-I really liked the uh, connection the textual connecstion-connection with insects I think it was the end of lesson 3, and we actually have um-a-a couple lizards as class pets and, we feed em crickets so, and then kids have been talking about finding dead, um cicadas all over the sidewalks this time of the year so, actually you know we took some of those and-and looked at them under digital microscopes um, as a whole class and it-it really um, enhanced that lesson and-and um, brought in a lot more connections and-to the outside world by, looking at the actual um, comb structures of the wings of-of the crickets and the layers-the membrane layers of the wings of uh, the uh cicadas it just, it really brought more into the lesson by them being able to see it for themselves as oppposed to just sitting on a-on the black and white text, of the article.  So I don't know I-"
[00:30:39.17],Renee, So you're saying some out-some outside application connections have kinda kept-have gotten-people
[00:30:44.12],Gerard, Yeah
[00:30:44.18],Renee, engagement in
[00:30:46.00],Wanda?, That's cool.
[00:30:46.13],Gerard, Yeah.
[00:30:47.26],Jamie, I like that. [3-second pause]
[00:30:52.03],Renee, Other thoughts?  What poeple have done for-for more challe-les-less engaged students? [3-second pause]
[00:31:02.23],Misty," I-I wouldn't necessarily call them less engaged students but I think what helps is, constantly going back to like posters we've made as a class um, to kinda be like hey let's look are there any more of these investigations that we've already done like so yesterday um, cause I was not in the room today like so I wasn't at school today and so yesterday I was moving one of the chart papers to like write something on it for them-and I noticed I was like oh we should go back to this list cause I've noticed a few more investigations that we've done um, that we-like didn't like check off that they-they should know like hey look this was your list and like, we can check off a few more of these um, and another thing that I did cause we had like two-there's like two posters going for each class about like, investigations they wanted to do, and so with one of the posters, um what we had gotten done was like, lo-when we first looked at instruments and things like that we were like checking those things off and then they still had these other investigations that like were things that I knew were coming, cause someone had some-had something about like a speaker and something about water and so like I knew they were coming but we weren't getting to them right then and so I had the students, we like looked at that list of investigations and I was like let's see if these are things we wanna do now if they're gonna help us with like this part A that we're trying to figure out or if they'll help us with another part and so we went and like labeled the investigations like where does this one fit and they were like oh that's  like a part B or that's a part C kind of a thing so they could-I think it helped them see like um, as we were like checking things off like for kids to be like, but I totally wanted to know what's gonna happen with water and we didn't do that and it's like well we'll get to that but like that's gonna help us maybe with like travel or like something else so like when we labeled them in a way that they could see okay we're gonna get to know later they were like okay with accepting that like "
[00:32:56.20],Michael, (there you go)
[00:32:56.28],Misty," we hadn't done (it) yet, and so I think-one of the things I wanna do tomorrow is I wanna like pull that other poster back out that like-we didn't label in that way um and check off what we've done and then see like hey are there some other things that we still need to and what will they help us figure out so kinda keep-reconnecting them back to like why we had those questions and I noticed um, cause I-something I said to the class that I was talking about like so-oh someone was like, like are we-they were asking like were we done or how-how much longer we have in the unit [scattered chuckles] and I was like well we still have a lot to figure out you know I was like we have a ton of questions we haven't answered and we haven't like taken any quesitons off yet even though there are some that we can and so what I've noticed now is like on the way out cause-when you come in or out of the classroom you're gonna walk right by like the driving question board and I wa-I'll see kids like periodically like over there like looking at like post it notes trying to be like are we even on this list like whe-where are we and so like I think just like re-engaging them with stuff that they had a part in creating, helps them kind of like stay motivated, so even if they-weren't they're like oh okay so the reason we didn't look at the water yet is cause it's gonna help us with like something else. [shrugs] I don't know I think at least that's been"
[00:34:07.15],Renee, Wow that's cool
[00:34:09.09],Misty, helpful
[00:34:09.18],Renee, that's a cool idea.  And it's a nice way to say
[00:34:11.22],Michael, I-it's
[00:34:13.20],Renee," not, i-it's a nice way to say when they say we wanna do you know, not y-yet"
[00:34:17.09],Misty, Mm.
[00:34:16.25],Renee," Right they have a reason for it.  So we heard two things about engagement, outside connections to other things related to sound are helping kids to engage and then going back to anything that they've generated as a class and their ideas for questions and investigations and-sort of really checking in and using that often to say look you guys wanted to know this now we're still going here where do you wanna go and-and you might even be able to pull some of those kids in like which question was yours up here have we figured that one out yet? as a way to get them in."
[00:34:48.21],Gerard, It could be
[00:34:48.10],Renee, Michael you were gonna say one thing before we--you wanted to go ahead
[00:34:51.00],Michael, I just as-I  ju-um no I like that you're summarizing cause I feel like we can use this uh again in step 4
[00:34:58.14],Renee," Yeah, definitely"
[00:34:58.15],Michael, cause I remember a similar thing came up in our other study group is-the power of checking in the board so that
[00:35:05.03],Renee, Yeah
[00:35:05.12],Michael," kids identify for themselves like oh, we're a third of the way through our mission. [chuckles]"
[00:35:10.00],Misty, Mm-hmm.
[00:35:10.09],Renee, Yeah.  Definitely.
[00:35:13.08],Gerard, Can I mention one more thing
[00:35:12.22],Renee, (Wanda) did you have something
[00:35:12.24],Wanda," No not a question but my class did have a meeting at the driving question board I had each class go up to the driving question board I had each class go up to the questions for part A and say uh have we answered this question and we had a discussion that way, and the kids enjoyed doing that.  And I will continue to do that.  So.  Yeah"
[00:35:36.05],Renee, Yeah.  Gerard?
[00:35:38.12],Gerard," [holding pen in front of camera] Um.  for those of us in Chicago have you guys ever heard of Andy's music, Andy's music store?  It's a store in Rosco village I'm trying to think of, it's located, on Ellston well actually that's not Rosco village but it's-it's one of the few music stores in Chicago where they have instuments from all over the world and-and I real-it-it's almost like a museum walking through there and the instruments aren't that expensive, but I'm gonna go back and-and now that I think I'm gonna go back and purchase one it-it almost looks like a glass bowl, where you-wave a wand in the middle of it but you're not even touching the bowl and it makes this really, low-pitched humming sound, um, as-as-and it's a musical instrument um I think it's from Peru or somewhere I can't recall exactly but, I mean there's just another tie-in where kids could really be wondering wait a minute, you're not even touching it you're not even applying force and that's making sound, so-I don't know just-other types of musical instruments"
[00:36:39.08],Renee, So I-I
[00:36:41.13],Gerard," could be, things to keep em cur-even more curious."
[00:36:45.12],Renee, And could help motivate the next step right oops I'm echoing
[00:36:49.11],Jamie," But I-I do feel like Gerard [echoing] I think we're starting to bring in more of that and I-I bring in a speaker can we all go to the auditorium I'm the sound guy for the play I spent four hours about sound I-I feel like they although there's some that aren't there they-as a whole they're kind of more starting to get, how this works as like, a system."
[00:37:13.08],Michael, Mm.
[00:37:15.21],Renee, I would love to hear
[00:37:16.27],Michael, So
[00:37:17.13],Renee, a-u-er-go ahead Michael did you have something before we go to-hearing about coherence
[00:37:22.19],Michael, Well actually that's what I was-think-maybe anticipating to-too
[00:37:27.14],Renee, same brain?
[00:37:27.22],Michael," I was like it s-sounds like that's a noticing that Jamie had about some elements of coherence that, d-wanted to share with the group the kids are kind of-and I heard her say like kind of-coming around to be like hey I gotta help-pull the wagon a little bit and I get what that involves [echo] um, maybe just um go around and uh-have each person share sort of a thing that, a noticing related to coherence, um.  And uh if you remember sort of this-this step 2 now talking sticks if you all go to step 2 and remind ourselves that we wanna make sure that we get a noticing from everyone so get a lot of opportunities to riff in different directions, on a second round um where we can then comment or build off of or-kind of think about how those ideas can connect together.  Um. Maybe I-undercut Jamie's-note-maybe Jamie had a different one-noticing but it felt like it was a sort of noticing about coherency.  So-throw it back to you Jamie is there more you wanna say about that or, did you wanna pass it to someone else"
[00:38:26.17],Renee, And Michael do you wanna-
[00:38:27.26],Jamie, My guess is
[00:38:28.02],Renee, say that-coherence related to like helping kids figure out where they're going between the end of one lesson and the-and the next?  Is that where we wanna sort of focusing
[00:38:36.15],Michael," Good ca-that's a good point, right yeah we do wanna think at a-at a grain size of like the biggest jumps in coherence are like, we at wrap up let's say you know lesson 2 and we're trying to get to lesson 3 or, 5 to 6 and, and some lessons it may be easier to s-to bring the kids along for the ride and others you might be like ooh that was choppy that like I-I really felt like I was pulling, and I didn't have the kids with me for the rationale and so if you wanna comment on any of those that-you've noticed um, I think it'd be useful for the group to kinda then see that space and think about like how to work with those challenges and opportunities uh for really helping kids connect one lesson to the next whether it's at the end of one lesson or the start of another.  Um [nods] and uh"
[00:39:18.02],Renee," Yeah.  And we can kinda go around just to-to make sure everyone gets a chance I will set the timer just to sort of, you guys always just sort of flow through it but-if you-if someone wants to comment and then when your turn's done you can call on somebody else or you can sort of Gerard does a good job of showing his pen saying you know I got something [scattered chuckles]"
[00:39:34.29],Gerard, The talking stick
[00:39:37.09],Renee, Talking stick!  So does anybody wanna start us out? [4-second pause]
[00:39:43.00],Misty," Um, I-I can start, uh, I never have a talking stick but, um, so I, actually got uh, I have lesson six, papers in from of me that I just got from my students and so like they just finished, um, the student activity sheet and so the last questions on the back are always like next steps like you know what did we do and so like and-for-throughout lesson six in particular um, it's having them go back to the needle um, and the record and starting to think about, how like what they figure out connects to um, how we might be able to hear different pitches and different volumes on the record and then like how could we go about investigating that and so, what I noticed just looking at like the first few when I was like looking at them, is that s-a lot of students are saying, well, so there must be something on the surface that's causing the different pitches like we have those different kind of like lengths and bars and things like that, um, and then the things that they wanna, start investigating they're like, maybe we could zoom in some more to see what the needle does, type of a thing, so they kinda wanna like go back to where we-which was I was like oh good you wanna do what we're gonna do anyway ahh!  Um but it's good to like see that that's kinda where they are.  (Yeah) [7-second pause] Um"
[00:41:12.06],Michael, Misty
[00:41:13.23],Misty, (what I thought I heard)
[00:41:13.29],Michael, pass it to so-pass it to someone else
[00:41:14.08],Misty," oh yeah I was like I thought I heard the time or something.  Sure!  Um, (I don't know), Wanda? [chuckles]"
[00:41:22.23],Gerard, [chuckles?]
[00:41:23.06],Wanda," Um, my students are not coming up with questions very easily so if you have a strategy to get from there that would be helpful.  That's-they're not-sharing a whole lot one student said well we can go on the Internet and research blah blah blah you know, so.  They're not into, [indistinct]"
[00:41:44.10],Renee," Wanda have you had-have you h-ave you had any instances where you said like well what do you wanna know more about have they come up with anything there or, (not much)"
[00:41:50.22],Wanda," Oh, that's a good question, I can try that [nods] [5-second pause]"
[00:41:58.02],Renee, All right we'll come back around 
[00:42:00.08],Wanda, Okay
[00:42:00.14],Renee, for that Wanda.
[00:42:02.19],Michael?, [indistinct] [5-second pause] Can you call on our next person? [2-second pause]
[00:42:11.03],DeAnn, I'll go.  [clears throat] Want me to go? [Michael gives thumbs up]
[00:42:17.20],Renee, Sure
[00:42:19.03],DeAnn," All right, um I was gonna say that I was having, um, trouble with them wanting to, bond to the next lesson with thinking back moving forward, my group is, students who have been together for, quite a few years, they call them the ace studnts, so, they're very um, at-they're not like my other class put it that way but they know a lot [chuckles], and so they would-felt like they knew everything about sound, and um, I ended up having to, when we started with instruments, to get them to (walk) move forward see how it worked with instruments, um, I had em draw how it worked with the drum, first, before they had to play with cause they-they were so sure they know it all, so they made their model, their model drawing, some show this sequence others just the drum, then, (whose) the drum and we do-uh show the slow motion of all of them, and, that they got (hooked in and) wanna know more they wanted to go back to their model system and [indistinct-interference] [chuckles] because they could see they didn't know it all and then they wanted to do more they wanted to move forward more into the other instruments and, it-kind of hooked them into let's go farther, let's find more, what's next, because they were just sure they knew it all. [2-second pause] [laughs] And they did some great drawings with a lot on it but they didn't know all [chuckles] so, now they're like, wanting to go far forward, I hate to say I had to kinda like-it sounds like I had to tear em down to build them up, but"
[00:44:22.08],Michael, We c-w-we c-
[00:44:22.19],DeAnn, see that they don't know like (frequency)
[00:44:24.22],Michael," We-we call that problematizing, [alarm goes off] DeAnn [scattered chuckles]"
[00:44:28.26],Wanda, Problematizing. [scattered chuckles continue]
[00:44:31.02],Renee," Problematizing with a phenomenon right with the slow motion you know that's what helps them, "
[00:44:37.02],DeAnn, Yup
[00:44:37.08],Renee, see that they wanted more.  So- all right you wanna call on someone
[00:44:39.17],DeAnn," And they were, okay um, all right [indistinct]"
[00:44:45.09],Renee, And we'll come back around. [5-second pause] Say it again?
[00:44:51.04],DeAnn, Gerald?
[00:44:53.28],Renee, Gerard?
[00:44:53.13],Gerard," Oh.  Thank you, um"
[00:44:56.02],DeAnn," Oh there you go, Gerard, I don't have my-I better put my glasses on"
[00:44:59.01],Gerard, [chuckles] you're fine
[00:45:00.07],Renee, Right
[00:45:01.24],Gerard," Um,"
[00:45:01.18],DeAnn, [with glasses] Okay
[00:45:03.01],Gerard," So-I wanted to bring up uh an issue that came about and forgive me if we talked about this during our last meeting but it was during, lesson 4 with the laser, I'm not 100% sure my students got the most out of what was supposed to be transferred into lesson 5 from that.  For example, some of em were still skeptical that all objects when they vibrate and make sound they-there's actually some elasticity to it, so-did anybody else experience, that same problem to where you're not sure, if you, answered that question or showed that through that demonstration? [1.5-second pause]"
[00:45:53.09],Renee, Jamie you were nodding.
[00:45:56.07],Jamie," [nodding] Yeah I-I kind of addressed it in lesson 5, with the big stick and coming back to the instrument and saying (look,) and what I also did is when they did the, uh, Gerard have your kids done the vibrating moon and the vibrating Big Ben reading?"
[00:46:10.24],Gerard, Yeah.
[00:46:12.22],Jamie," Um, I kinda held off on that one like I didn't do it right after, 4,"
[00:46:17.19],Gerard, Okay
[00:46:17.24],Jamie," Like, I came back and I was like you guys, like still didn't really believe me, wait-not believe me, we still-we-I felt like you guys still were processing this, and so then we did the, we like really took apart like, the bell, and talking about that, and then-kind of the moon and then now we're looking at, talking about like how we can use the big stick in lesson 5 like, to show something vibrating, um, we've gone back we've had to go back and do-done the laser on the table like three or four times, like, at least once in each of my classes [Michael chuckles] like reminding "
[00:46:57.25],Gerard, Okay
[00:46:58.14],Jamie," them the table was-or I meant now I feel like as of today-they're like, it's bendy!  It's flimsy!  Like they're-every class is using some different word to talk about it deforming, it's warped!"
[00:47:09.21],Gerard, [chuckles]
[00:47:09.27],Jamie," Um, but, it"
[00:47:11.07],Gerard, But you had to revisit it. Is what you're saying.
[00:47:14.07],Jamie, Yeah.  And it wasn't like we
[00:47:14.13],Gerard, Okay
[00:47:16.11],Jamie," I guess my like noticing is like lesson 4 was really clunky for me? And, like, kind of like someone said earlier I had them, I whiteboarded, I had them whiteboard like-what was happening with the record and then write it wi-with a partner and then write it on their own and then-then and like finish it at home and then the next day I came through and I had like, a bunch of kids read their conclusions (about) the record, and then I went through and it was like these are the six pieces that I wanna make sure everyone has in their conclusion and I like, we went through each piece and if they had it in their conclusion they underlined it, and put like a 1 next to it, and if they didn't have it they had to add some version of it, and I think it really helped my kids finally like understand, ho-like the level of depth they need in their writing.  Cause when they, when they did the whiteboard they're like I'm done in like 2 seconds and I was like [gestures] um"
[00:48:17.11],Gerard," So-so you were able to get em to um, to see it with revisiting the demo of the laser and the way it moved like with the t-hitting the table?"
[00:48:27.01],Jamie, Yeah I also got reflective tape. [timer goes off]
[00:48:30.11],Gerard, Okay.
[00:48:31.10],Laura, Ooh what'd you do with the reflective tape?
[00:48:33.19],Jamie," Um, we put it on the drum, and then on the table, um, it also helped (with)"
[00:48:41.21],Renee, Instead of the mirror.
[00:48:43.05],Jamie, Instead of-we did it with the mirror and then we also did it with the reflective tape.
[00:48:47.17],Laura, Okay
[00:48:48.17],Michael, Yeah
[00:48:48.02],Jamie," Um, to show that it really was the table was really moving, and a bunch of them like [demonstrating] put their head like, [scattered chuckles] and got on the table with their head.  Um."
[00:48:59.10],Michael, Cause they say-
[00:48:59.27],Jamie, but
[00:49:00.06],Michael, Isn't it right Jamie they s-cause we saw on a beta pallet kids are like oh it's the mirror that's bouncing up and down it's still (ain't)
[00:49:06.12],Jamie, Yeah
[00:49:06.23],Michael," the table.  So it's like, fine [chuckles] we were like you skeptics we made you into skeptics [chuckles]"
[00:49:11.24],Jamie," But I-I really feel like it was the giant stick, like that's when they fin-they were like oh yeah. (like) letting them "
[00:49:21.15],Renee, So Jamie you're sort of renforce-
[00:49:21.13],Jamie, play with--
[00:49:22.17],Renee," reinforcing this idea this sort of like incrementally building ideas and that not all kids are gonna get, totally there at the same time and so, multiple ways and multiple lessons to help them, get there, is that"
[00:49:35.04],Jamie, Yeah [2-second pause] Yes.
[00:49:39.07],Renee, Are-Laura we haven't heard from you yet [smiles]
[00:49:41.05],Laura," So um, I'm-i-if we're talking about coherence um, when I originally started this I, have two science classes and my teaching partner who teaches language arts and social studies agreed to try to teach the other science while I was teaching one group, and after about two weeks of this we have realized that that is not gonna work, she just doesn't have the time to put into this to do it, to give it the time that it needs so just this week we've gone to um, I'm gonna teach my group on Mondays and Tuesdays I'm gonna teach her group on Thursdays and Fridays so it'll be somewhere around 2019 by the time I finish this unit [scattered chuckles] Um, [laughs] but we're gonna get this"
[00:50:22.26],Jamie," That's how I do it Laura, that's how I do it [nodding]"
[00:50:26.13],Laura," Yeah.  So um, coherence what I'm finding is that the group that I started with, because I had so much a deeper understanding of this, we're doing a f-a really fine job I feel like getting, the concepts and going back and revisiting, but with the other group that started with my partner, they're kinda lost and today was the first day that I had them and I thought oh my heaven, we're kinda gonna have to revisit a lot, so we're gonna do-start lesson 4, on Monday, and I'm really intrigued to see what you guys did to make that work better cause I was reading through and I thought this has, potential to not really, it could be a little clunky maybe, um I love the idea the reflective tape cause my first thing was they're"
[00:51:11.19],DeAnn, Yeah [nodding]
[00:51:12.10],Laura," gonna (think) to me it's the mirror, that's what they're gonna say to me"
[00:51:14.07],DeAnn, Yeah [smiling] (mine too)
[00:51:15.06],Laura," Um, so I love that idea.  So I'm finding I have two groups and two really really different places of understanding right now, and it's probably gonna take me a little while to find out where the second group really is and what they understand cause I haven't really been reading their stuff or seeing what they've been writing, um, but this is just how we're gonna have to roll with it.  Um, I feel like, since we end almost every day with a scientist meeting we don't leave, until they've argued out, what they think is going on [timer goes off] um, a-and that seems to be working."
[00:51:52.27],Michael, Mm. [4-second pause]
[00:51:56.15],Renee," So we've-we've heard quite a few ideas around, so-DeAnn you were talking about using, sort of the ordering of when you present a phenomenon to help them see that they need to go deeper, right, we heard, um, Misty you were say-saying you're pulling straight from the activ-like y-they always get asked like what should we do next and being able to pull from that as a way to, say okay wow"
[00:52:23.21],Misty, mm-hmm
[00:52:24.10],Renee," this is-you wanted this so this is where we're going, kind of thing, um, Gerard and um, Jamie just talking about this idea that it's gonna take lots of revisits for ideas, to be able to, not only build that coherence so that they wa-they know where they wanna go next but also to-to sort of construct the ideas, um and then we still have this sort of hanging question out there about u-which might help, Wanda's question which is how do I get kids to ask more of the questions or want to ask more things, so, I'm just wondering if anybody has anything that they wanna share with Wanda before we move on to, look at some more of the tools and some more of the ways that we could help-provide, help-students with the coherence, does anybody have any, suggestions or ideas for Wanda about ways to help get-kids asking more questions? [Gerard has pencil up] Go ahead Gerard."
[00:53:15.28],Gerard," Um, Wanda? [2-second pause]"
[00:53:17.27],Wanda, Yes
[00:53:19.08],Gerard, is she there?--oh hi
[00:53:20.12],Wanda, Yep!
[00:53:21.01],Gerard," Um do you-give them, do you guys um do small group uh question sessions first before you go back whole group?  I found it's very helpful cause I have a-experienced that too where uh where I notice there's lulls in um the questioning coming from the students I-I give them more opportunities to come up with questions in small groups and then when we come back whole-group um, there's more um, more-more of it is coming from-from the kids themselves, and it-it also is um, it helps too when-when I'm walking around and listening to their questions I can then point out and say you know you guys asked a really good question over there why don't you share that, with the class so I think-I just think uh groupthink kinda helps um generate questions um, as opposed to me just asking the whole class all right what questions do you have.  [2-second pause]"
[00:54:14.21],Wanda," Well I appreciate that, I had not tried that strategy cause usually we're on such a time crunch and I'm trying to get the, lesson done, so-I think I really didn't spend enough time on it, you know give em enough think time to even come up with the question so I think that problem's on me, probably, "
[00:54:35.12],Jamie, No Wanda I- 
[00:54:35.11],Wanda, not that they (don't care)
[00:54:36.16],Jamie," I felt that time crunch too, and I just had to really, flo-I was like I gotta get this lesson it says it's this long I gotta"
[00:54:44.16],Wanda," Me too I gotta get it done, I gotta get it done "
[00:54:46.05],Jamie, Like-I'm like [indistinct] like (I know)
[00:54:48.26],Wanda, but that think time is important
[00:54:50.13],Jamie," Yeah.  Um so like lesson 6 I know is gonna take-I thought I could do it in my like Friday 40-minute period and I'm like you know what we're gonna do like half of it, but-one thing that I've started doing is I feel like-I don't know if my kids are just really distracted, but they're like always being like oh, what if the-what if we did this, and I'm like, like-not like earlier in the lesson, like when we st-we do like, keep it-so I've been like, I guess planting seeds earlier in the lesson about oh, that's a really-we-could we do that?  And-like, I didn't-um, and then coming back to it at the end of class being like remember when Peter said this, like half an hour ago Peter can you remind us, and that-and then like kinda like hinging on it a little"
[00:55:42.08],Wanda," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm"
[00:55:43.27],Jamie," just helps like just picking up on one kid anyone have a different idea, from Peter's, would just like-not being so worried about doing exactly what is in the lesson plan in the time that it says and-slowing down and like letting the kids kind of as Michael would say riff for a little bit,"
[00:56:02.02],Wanda, mm
[00:56:02.08],Jamie," Um, and then bring in that, [2-second pause]"
[00:56:05.28],Gerard," You've covered all the buzzwords in that one, statement [scattered laughs and chuckles]"
[00:56:11.05],Michael," It sounded good, I should-did we record that [Jamie holds up her mug, which has something written on it, and people laugh]"
[00:56:14.25],Renee, Sure [indistinct]
[00:56:15.15],Misty, [laughing] is this thing on
[00:56:16.16],Renee," So-to-if it's o-does anybody else have any last-last comment there we're-um, because we do wanna try to get to some of the other tools stuff and things tonight did anybody have any last comments"
[00:56:26.23],Laura," So Wanda, we got a lot of um, we can look it up on the Internet, we can, listen to a podcast, we can-you know we got a lot of that and I-"
[00:56:37.08],Wanda, Okay
[00:56:38.01],Laura," (and) I realized it was my issue in that I probably when I rephrased the question to, what do you wanna do, what can we examine closer, let's leave the Inter-I actually had to say let's leave the Internet out of it [scattered chuckles] because i-although they were really good and some of the things like when we were looking at the-the needle and the record player even though I knew that was coming that we were gonna get a piece of the, video clip"
[00:57:04.25],Wanda?, [indistinct]
[00:57:05.03],Laura," they just instantaneously got on their iPads and looked up video clips of, of records and needles and-and-on at electronic microscopes so it was basically like, w-what can I bring you what could we find, where could we go, and that sort of got them thinking a little crazier and wilder, and then we got better questions."
[00:57:25.09],Wanda, Okay.  I will try all these tips
[00:57:26.11],Michael," What could we do, what I could "
[00:57:28.25],Renee, That's great
[00:57:28.29],Michael, I bring you
[00:57:29.14],Renee," Yeah we'll kinda-bring you, all such great ideas, "
[00:57:31.18],Jamie, Keep talking about-
[00:57:32.24],Renee, and we'll
[00:57:32.07],Jamie, oh
[00:57:33.25],Renee, go ahead
[00:57:34.02],Jamie, my friend at Northwestern [laughs]
[00:57:35.18],all, [scattered laughs]
[00:57:38.12],Jamie," Or like I'm just [indistinct] cause like I'm right here so they're like, yesterday they were like we gotta look at how this moves and I was like well I'm just gonna call my friends at Northwestern and see what they have that could like, "
[00:57:47.08],Wanda," Right, right"
[00:57:48.23],Jamie, So
[00:57:49.10],Renee," [chuckling] that's good, I love it"
[00:57:52.20],Jamie, and starting a 
[00:57:53.04],Renee, all right
[00:57:53.18],Jamie, [indistinct] and starting a
[00:57:54.24],Wanda, [indistinct] and go on
[00:57:53.08],Jamie," they started calling it my ""rich friend"" my ""rich friends"" at Northwestern"
[00:57:57.06],Misty, [laughs]
[00:57:57.12],Wanda, (what) you say
[00:57:58.18],Misty," And I s-I too have rich friends they were like where did you get this how much did it cost I was like I don't know it came from Northwestern they were like oh, [all laugh]"
[00:58:05.16],Jamie, Your rich friend.
[00:58:06.29],Renee," Oh we got it, your friends at Northwestern"
[00:58:09.24],Misty, [laughs]
[00:58:10.06],Renee," All right this is awesome thank you guys so much for, such good ideas let's see if we can move on to, step 3, and, we wanna talk a little bit about, um, still related to this idea of coherence, that-you know we get psyched when a student raises an idea that's in the direction of where we wanna go and Jamie was just speaking to that directly, right they might bring up a-something earlier in the lesson that you know you're gonna get to, right, um, or, maybe you're trying to just do some sense-making around pitch or amplitude and-you know a kid says something you're like yes, we got it, but, we know that there might be kids in the class or that-that understanding might be tentative like Gerard was talking about so we wanna get those ideas to spread, right we want kids to be interacting with what ideas they're putting out there and not just sort of like taking the first answer that comes out, and so-um, helping students work with those ideas for a while can be a little bit challenging, and so I remember this summer, we had this tool this strategic inquiry tool which-um, is linked there on step 3 that has a bunch of, talk moves, and goals that we're trying to support with those talk moves, and so we wanted to take a minute to look at that, and, for ourselves take a look at it and you're gonna be looking at this tool f-with two questions in mind, the first one is to identify some of those moves, or goals that you have been using that you think are helpful in getting the ideas to spread or getting students to work with each other's ideas.  And then also be looking for some that you haven't used as much that you would like to incorporate.  So, we're on step 3 if you could open the strategic inquiry tool and-take about 3 minutes to look through it and see if you can identify some that you're using, and some that you would like to use that you're not as much yet.  Are there any questions about what you're doing?"
[01:00:16.04],Michael, And-and-in service of getting ideas to spread.
[01:00:19.13],Renee," in service in getting ideas to spread in service of getting kids to work with each other's ideas, which is all in service of, [gestures]"
[01:00:26.04],Wanda, Mm-hmm
[01:00:27.10],Renee," [gestures again] sense-making and coherence, right. [4-second pause] I'll set the timer and we'll see where we're h-see how we-see where we are, when the timer goes off. [23-second pause]"
[01:01:01.11],Jamie, Are we posting or are we just thinking?
[01:01:05.09],Renee," Right now you're just identifying and thinking and then you're gonna share out so you might wanna jot-you know you can, make a little note to yourself about what-what you wanna say or, what-which one do you wanna share. [25 seconds of silence]"
[01:01:40.11],Gerard, Renee?
[01:01:42.00],Renee, [nods]
[01:01:42.14],Gerard, Renee?
[01:01:42.27],Renee, Yes?--yep
[01:01:44.28],Gerard," Are we supposed to be, is there s-like a-something that we learned over the summer that we're supposed to be referring to when you say talk moves, or-"
[01:01:54.16],Renee, So do you-do you see the tool that's on step three the strategic inquiry tool
[01:01:59.23],Wanda, I have a paper copy [chuckles]
[01:02:03.25],Renee, And it-all right uh
[01:02:04.17],Michael, Top left corner
[01:02:06.12],Renee," Top left corner,"
[01:02:07.11],Gerard, Oh yeah yeah yeah
[01:02:09.10],Renee, Yeah
[01:02:10.09],Gerard, So that thing-okay
[01:02:11.14],Renee, Yeah yeah
[01:02:12.18],Gerard, Thank you
[01:02:13.09],Renee," And we-you had like a color-coded version of that this summer that we used when we were analyzing some video, this is just a non-colored version of it"
[01:02:21.20],Gerard," Okay.  I see okay. [6-second pause] Cause these are things that I think, we all do? [2-second pause]"
[01:02:36.05],Renee," [begins speaking, is muted]"
[01:02:36.00],Gerard," So are you asking from our own practice,"
[01:02:38.15],Renee," Yeah yeah so-which o-so of these-there are these sort of five goals of this discussions that we want and then there are some moves that can support those goals,"
[01:02:46.13],Gerard, Okay I got it
[01:02:47.20],Renee, and we want you to look for all 5 and see if there are some that you feel like yeah I readily use those but these I don't 
[01:02:52.11],Gerard, Okay thank you
[01:02:52.20],Renee, and I'd like to use more of.  Yeah
[01:02:53.15],Gerard," Thank you [1 minute, 35 seconds of silence]"
[01:04:27.04],Renee," Like about thirty more seconds and then we would love to hear, from you guys [3-second pause]"
[01:04:34.05],Laura, Do you want us to be writing right now?
[01:04:35.14],Renee," You don't have to be writing.  You can if you want but you can just-[gestures] [2-second pause, Gerard? types]"
[01:04:40.19],Laura, I hear typing [scattered chuckles]
[01:04:43.19],Renee, I think Ger-Gerard's typing
[01:04:44.00],DeAnn?, I do too
[01:04:47.18],Michael," I-it could be someone else uh-maybe,"
[01:04:51.05],Misty, [laughs]
[01:04:51.14],Michael, if-
[01:04:53.08],Misty, You're furious (you're just)
[01:04:53.04],Gerard, Oh is my typing making too much noise
[01:04:55.29],Misty, [laughs]
[01:04:56.27],Laura?, (I'm sorry) Gerard I just-
[01:04:57.15],Gerard, Was it-
[01:04:59.00],Jamie?, (it was feeling different from [indistinct])
[01:04:58.25],Gerard, Was my typing making too much noise?
[01:05:00.06],Renee, [indistinct] [timer goes off] (you're like we're feeling like) slackers
[01:05:01.21],Misty, [laughing] (we were like what was I typing)
[01:05:03.28],Renee," okay.  All right so what'd you-what'd you come up with here I'd love-we'd love to hear what i-what-what-what do you feel like you're realizing and, what end, and which ones are-would you like to sort of mark for yourself to-like I gotta do that more.  Anybody can start."
[01:05:21.17],Wanda, Well I find-I start
[01:05:22.11],DeAnn, (why don't you start)
[01:05:23.00],Wanda, Oh one two and three really well but I definitely need to work on 5.  I think I do a good job with 4 as well but-I need to work on 5.
[01:05:37.23],Renee," Uh-can you say a little bit more about like, what about 5 sort of stood out for you that you feel like, isn't, [indistinct]"
[01:05:44.15],Wanda," Um, well in goal 5 it says where did we leave off, what do we need to figure out next, I mean--but, I (kinda) use that even within the lesson [2-second pause] maybe uh how can what we figure out today help us with other questions we've identified [4-second pause]"
[01:06:10.08],Gerard, Hmm.
[01:06:11.14],Renee, So utilizing some of those
[01:06:11.01],Wanda, [indistinct] (I think I've used that one before) [2-second pause]
[01:06:16.19],Renee, Great
[01:06:18.26],Wanda," And I-uh should have spoke up for lesson 4 but I changed that lesson a little bit, um, to meet-uh strategic questions for digging into evidence from an investigation, I reformatted that page they had to write a claim and evidence 1 evidence 2 evidence 3, evidence 1 being what did they observe with the drum, evidence 2 being what the deal (was) with the small rock, and evidence 3 what did they observe with the large rock and then the (beesmake) and that seemed to help"
[01:06:51.03],Renee," Very cool.  And you're making a connection to some-to-to, some of the goal 3 moves right like what evidence do you have "
[01:07:01.22],Wanda, Yes
[01:07:02.24],Renee," for that, yup"
[01:07:03.04],Wanda, Yup
[01:07:03.07],Renee," Nice. [2-second pause] who else would like to-share what goals, what moves they seem to be using and what they're-they would like to focus a little bit more on,"
[01:07:14.06],Jamie?," Um, 2 "
[01:07:17.21],Michael, Gerard? [has pen up in front of camera]
[01:07:17.29],Jamie, I think that I used
[01:07:18.07],Michael, Oh sorry go ahead Jamie
[01:07:21.00],Jamie," a lot are um, and this is in part due to my issues with engagement earlier, this same who can rephrase that can-who can repeat what so-and-so said there's so much power in being able to rephrase or repeat so I use that one a lot and then I'm also using my kids are now starting to sing the Grease song, tell me more tell me more cause I'm like tell me more! [scattered chuckles]  And um, yeah, so they make fun of me for that [nods] so I"
[01:07:51.19],Renee," Can I-can I just ask you one question you said there's so much power in that having someone-you know in doing that repeat or rephrase what do you mean by that like, what-what have you seen happen when kids are doing that"
[01:08:02.17],Jamie," Well I bring it back to the green sheet, um, and how their right-and obligation to the listener they have the right to an attentive audience and they're obligated um, I'm like looking at the green sheet I have over there, I'm obligated to speak loud enough so people can hear, and-we were having a real issue with kids talking at the same time, and so-um, I use it as a way that-that like they c-they shou-they're real-they're really listening, if they can rephrase or repeat what someone else said.  Um, it's also a way of you know making sure everyone's being loud like everyone's speaking with confidence my kids are having-we can only go in the science circle for a very short time right now they're like really into touching teach other inappropriately, [scattered chuckles] so, too close over there, so"
[01:08:54.13],Laura?, [indistinct] middle school
[01:08:56.13],Jamie," We do like a science circle at their tables you know, we have some of those conversations, um, but yeah."
[01:09:05.12],Renee, And-oh good-and
[01:09:06.28],Jamie, Um
[01:09:07.06],Renee, was there a goal uh that you-that you would like to incorporate more of?
[01:09:11.25],Jamie," I don't know if I'm doing as much asking them the like, but why are we doing this like how does this like, kinda like pulling it back to the how and the why of the, the big picture but also like the biiig picture, of-you know life and the world and-also just like bringing it back, to the driving question board like how does this connect, you know we didn't rea-like to back to the-to the record and the needle and how does that connect to like your actual life. [4-second pause, Gerard has pen up]"
[01:09:42.14],Renee, Cool.  Gerard?
[01:09:45.24],Gerard," Thank you um, going back to what um, we said earlier um, I've been using the talk move as well that Jamie using, where you ask a student um, who can repeat what so-and-so just said, um but I'm looking here on the-on the document that you just, reminded me we have it's uh goal 4 um, the last bullet point says explaining what someone else means, and the talk moves are who understands why x said that and what might she be thinking or why do you think he/she is telling us that, I think that's um, something that I wanna try, moving for-forward cause it really deep-I think it will really deepen their thinking and their way of explaining um, what they're thinking and then going back to-s-goal 3, um, I like the talk move of is your argument clear enough for others to understand because that would be a-a good talk move I think to use when we want them to go to the um, tracking sheets um, or just to-for argumentative writing or scientific uh, writing scientific explanations so, those are just some ones that I just noticed that I'm gonna-try more in the future."
[01:11:08.21],Renee, Very cool.  [1.5-second pause] Misty
[01:11:12.27],Misty," Yeah um, so what's interesting um, looking at this again I remember in the summer when we looked at this, I was thinking oh man goal 5 is going to be really difficult like that's what our-I felt like I would struggle with um, because I was like oh like goal 1 is something that I feel like I do like just naturally and what's funny is as I'm reading these now, um, if I had to say what I use most often I would say that it's a lot of goal 1 4 and 5 um because I feel like otherwise like well so how does this help us explain like the record I'm like cause remember like we're trying to be able to explain like how we're able to get sound from the record I feel like I say that all the time, and like the-it-it's always in the room, and so I feel like i-at some points kids are like-someone's always over there or like something would have happened, and then they like need to get closer and they wanna go look at it and I think it's good that it's there like constantly um, as like it's this constant reminder, um, because at first I was like well maybe that'd get like distracting but it really doesn't like they'll go over there and they'll go to do something so I think about when we finished lesson 5, um, we were thinking about like volume, and so I went back to um, even before they started writing their, questions about like what they wanted to do next, thinking about pitch a lot of them were, a lot of them came up with like we need to figure out how pitch works and like, maybe we can use that stick to help us again but I wouldn't-before we even-before they did that assignment I remember I went over to the anchoring phenomena and I just like started like spinning it again and someone was like yeah that's like super-like they were saying that it was like really, um, high or they were s-at first they were saying that it was really loud and I was like is it really loud like can you hear it like from your seat over there and somebody was like it's not loud it's like high pitched or like something like that, and so then"
[01:13:16.02],Renee, So Misty
[01:13:16.13],Misty, I was kinda like--
[01:13:18.29],Renee, Can I ask [indistinct] questions so are you saying
[01:13:19.02],Misty, Sure
[01:13:19.14],Renee, that you do-you tend to do a lot of 4 and 5s because you also have the artifacts right there and you're utilizing them to like
[01:13:27.11],Misty, Yeah
[01:13:28.08],Renee," help them say well what have we figured out and what's our next question and,"
[01:13:31.09],Misty, Yeah absolutely
[01:13:31.19],Renee, like the record like they hear those pitch again are there ones that to-that you're not using that you would like to use? (more?)
[01:13:39.06],Misty," Yeah so I think I would--like just in goal 3 I think these are things that, sometimes I'll ask us-like in a small group if I see something where I'm not quite understanding something but I-I think I wanna ask them more, aloud because like the conversation that usually follows is good conversation, and like more of them should hear it.  I don't tend to do that as a whole class I tend to do more of like 1 4 and 5 because those are experiences that we've all had but I think it might be good to like, do more of like when they have something on their individual paper of their small groups being like bring that up here put (under) the document so everybody can see and like could you tell them what you were talking to me about, so that they could be more, all experiencing."
[01:14:25.23],Renee, Nice. [2-second pause] Who have we not heard from?  DeAnn and Laura?
[01:14:31.19],Laura?, Mm-hmm.
[01:14:31.23],DeAnn," Yep.  I'll go next, um I'm-I'm pretty good with 1 and parts of others and-that's probably because I teach 3 grade levels, and I'm teaching this to 1 grade level, so I've had to make signs that say the start of those and put em over my back board to refer to because I-often seem to be forget-you know I-I-I'm in 3 different curriculums going so, they're posted so I glance up to remind myself to ask these questions with what (doing) um so I'm pretty good with that the way to approach em but I definitely need to work on 3 more of what is their evidence, for why they're saying what they say.  I don't think I go deep enough into, getting their evidence when they're making statements.  Even if their statement is correct, what evidence so that they're saying it out loud and others are hearing it also.  So"
[01:15:38.15],Renee," That makes sense, that makes sense.  [3-second pause] Laura do you wanna-finish us out?"
[01:15:44.20],Laura," Sure um, we hold so many meetings that yesterday we were doing a digital citizenship lesson and they decided to hold a citizens' meeting um, they-this is such a daily so I feel like they get it we get it but I don't do wrap-up well, that-as a teacher that is my I'm always rushing, rushing rushing rushing, you know I feel like I never give it the time at the end that I need so when I look at section 5 the-how did we figure this out who can talk us through what we did as a group today you know, how do we add to our summary table let's really look at your model can you add something to the model rather than me adding something to the model, that-that would be my real goal those are the ones that I really need to spend more time on.  And work on.  [nods]"
[01:16:32.24],Renee, And-which I think is the perfect-sort of segue to this idea too that if you're doing that then that's gonna help you lead to the next investigation
[01:16:41.10],DeAnn, Mm-hmm
[01:16:41.17],Renee," right if you can say this is what we figured out and this is how we figured it out and this is what we're adding, now it's like okay where do we go next.  So what we"
[01:16:48.00],Laura, Yeah I'm gonna put those ones on my hand
[01:16:50.29],Renee," Well that's what I was gonna say is print this darn thing out you know I have it on my-I have some version of it on my clipboard always cause I forget, or even just write a couple that you wanna make-make yourself (try down)"
[01:17:01.09],Misty, Yeah
[01:17:01.17],Renee, and what we'd like you to do is to try some-you can have a thousand (decisions) but take (a moment) at some point after you have a group discussion and reflect on it.
[01:17:13.10],Misty?, Mm-hmm
[01:17:13.16],Renee," Which goals you know did you feel like you were addressing, how did it go when you tried these 1 or 2 prompts that you've (really) wanted to try what did you get as a result so that we can think about that "
[01:17:23.06],DeAnn, Yes.
[01:17:24.08],Renee, and talk about that together next time.
[01:17:26.03],Wanda?, Sure
[01:17:26.14],DeAnn," And you can print em up like I did and post them on the wall the direct where I look, [chuckles] they're-they're (on there)"
[01:17:32.26],Renee, And they-the kids-the kids will use them too if you put them up so [scattered chuckles]
[01:17:39.06],DeAnn, I have (a third) up 
[01:17:38.21],Michael?, Ju-
[01:17:42.04],DeAnn, this way for the small group (they're facing) uh yeah
[01:17:44.11],Laura," You know that-I have sentence starters on my wall for the kids but one of the things I did is in their science notebooks, I made a list of sentence starters but I started them with what you might wanna do like if you want to-agree with someone here's things you can write, if you wanna disagree with someone, here's ways you can start a sentence, if you wanna add on, if you want to, get more information and I-they have found that really helpful to have that um, here's what I'm trying to do how do I get this piece of the conversation started um, and that's been super helpful for them as far as these conversations go."
[01:18:22.18],Michael?, Laura (could you post)
[01:18:23.28],Jamie, (would you mind sharing) this awesomeness with us (maybe)
[01:18:24.15],Misty, I was gonna ask if she could share those too
[01:18:27.03],Michael?," [indistinct, laughs]"
[01:18:27.21],Laura, Where do you want me to put it?
[01:18:28.26],Misty, (I was post) [indistcint]
[01:18:29.15],Laura, Just put it down here?
[01:18:30.28],Michael?, Do-yes just post on the step and put it
[01:18:31.08],Laura, All right I-I'll put it
[01:18:33.10],Michael?," And also Laura can you put it in our 8 point-in our Google Drive, there's "
[01:18:37.14],Laura, Okay
[01:18:37.20],Michael," there's a folder that says 8.0, and it's like-resources that the group is clamoring for us to share, "
[01:18:44.06],Laura, Okay
[01:18:44.12],Michael, so you can shove that up there and then it's not-you know we can all see it then in that sense.
[01:18:47.13],Laura, I'll do that right now.  Okay
[01:18:49.21],Michael, Awesome
[01:18:50.14],DeAnn," And-and I do the same thing you put em in your notebooks I posted those so they would ask in the science group um, they-they would ask the question the correct way, or I'd like to add on or could you please repeat-those are posted over my head where I sit in the science group cir-circle so-they notice we practice starting with those when they wanna (do something) and it's kept them from-down kept the-uh talking over each other down if that makes sense they're taking more turns. [2-second pause]"
[01:19:29.20],Renee," All right so thank you guys for that-that's a great discussion um, we're gonna-shift in our last 30 minutes to step 4 um, connecting to this coherence idea and I'm gonna turn it over to Michael."
[01:19:43.24],Michael," Cool.  So-I wanna like riff a little bit off of uh, the point that we were just wrapping up with, which was um, the-you know this idea that like sometimes if we don't have enough time to-to get to that goal 5, which-a lot of us were saying is one of our goals at the end of a lesson, right we might pick up with it at the start of the next lesson, and having these general purpose strategic inquiry prompts that we can use is helpful but it's also really helpful to know like wait where is the next lesson going, because the context-specific version of the prompt might be bigger bang for the buck right, how you frame it so like you're like, as we were saying before in one lesson oh we just figured out amplitude now what should we do might be the way for kids to say-or, we just figured out volume what should we look at next cause it was like pitch, you know so, I wanna go-take all these general tools and then map em over to where we're going and try to figure out are there specific instances of a type of question you say oh I could totally see asking this question, between these two lessons in bend 2 and it would lay for a really smooth (co-driving) of the lesson-end of one lesson to the start of the next whether it's-actually at the end of the period of the lesson or at the start of the next lesson it would really help strengthen coherence between, between the two lessons and we did this kind of in the summer you may remember us picking out post-its and laying out our post-its and being like here's what the lesson is targeting but here's how we would go from one lesson to the next"
[01:21:24.14],Wanda, Mm-hmm
[01:21:25.15],Michael," I want us thinking about that in terms of like what's a prompt, even just like one that we might ask that would really help that on-ramp from one lesson to the other.  So that's our goal up in-in step 4 if we could all go to that and take a, peek at what's on step 4 that's our looking forward, [3-second pause]"
[01:21:45.04],Gerard, I'm pulling up a picture of that color-coded board we hate we made [smiles] that I took on my phone
[01:21:50.10],Jamie, I look at that all the time.
[01:21:53.18],Michael, Yay [claps]
[01:21:55.06],Laura?, I love that board.
[01:21:56.26],Michael," So we're gonna try to do a version of that without being redundant uh from the storyline document you know the storyline is a little bit more detailed than the board was, uh but sometimes reading between the lines in the storyline can still help you see oh I can totally see how to connect these 2 together.  I would ask this prompt to the kids or would help-advance our thinking.  So just to get us oriented to the sound storyline for bend 2 we thought we'd look at it together and just kind of talk through, wait we're coming off of lesson 7 at the end of bend 1 into lesson 8 let's just all focus on that one together like what's the question that lesson 8's going to be focused on and how are we gonna foreground or motivate that based on where we end up at the end of 7 and it's quite-it's kind of a discontinuous jump because end of lesson 7 is the end of bend 1, start of lesson 8 is the start of bend 2 so I think this will be challenging for us to think wait how are we going to get from the end of 7 to the start of 8 so could you all open up the document that says sound storyline for bend 2? [echo] [14-second pause]"
[01:23:18.04],DeAnn?, I'm having technical difficulties. [Michael nods] Trying to reconnect. [echoes] [2.5-second pause]
[01:23:29.04],Michael," Okay.  As we're-jumping in there those who are connected scroll down to the top of page 2 [echoes], [10-second pause] and our goal is what is lesson 8 [echo] I'm getting a little bit of feedback here"
[01:23:54.03],Renee, Maybe if people could mute themselves just so that if you're not talking just so we could avoid that (might be good) [5-second pause]
[01:24:05.00],Michael, Let's spend a minute looking at that thinking about like what's lesson 8 really trying to focus on what's this question and how are we foregrounding that question as we move from lesson 7 to 8 what's the-what's the bridge in coherence from the students' perspective. [53-second pause] And then when someone's ready maybe they can raise a hand and start us off.  [2-second pause] Or their pen. [44-second pause] Any takers?  On-what's our question for-that we're trying to foreground for lesson 8? [11-second pause]
[01:26:17.12],Jamie, How does-the sound travel from the truck--[lights go on in Jamie's room] hey Erin! Oh-to the window?  To make the window move? [4-second pause]
[01:26:32.06],Michael," Cool.  Do others wanna add into that? [Gerard begins talking and but is muted] (Gerard) your microphone's muted you unmute [6-second pause, Gerard unmutes and remutes, 6 more seconds of silence] You remuted it Gerard you pressed it and it unmuted and then I saw it went muted again [chuckling]"
[01:27:06.28],Gerard," My Chromebook's like, (hoppin) around here on this table um, I think the emphasis is on the transition to the actual media that the sound's traveling through versus the source so it-it, is that what you're looking for here I mean, [1.5-second pause] um,"
[01:27:28.25],Michael, So what do others think doe-do we feel like lesson-end of lesson 7 sort of is really focused on the source and now we're shifting to the medium? [3-second pause]
[01:27:38.03],Jamie, I agree
[01:27:41.07],Misty," I f-...that's what it seems like,"
[01:27:42.29],Michael, So now I wanna be a-a kid
[01:27:45.28],Misty, but so-
[01:27:46.27],Michael, So
[01:27:47.06],Misty," so cause one of the-I haven't, I-I'm gonna be starting 7 and so I know you know there's the assessment and I know they have that-those (little) sticks like I haven't-I don't know enough about what they're gonna do in 7 to know if at the end of 7 they're gonna be like oh great let's look at this music moving from this-you know I don't know yet what that connection-it's hard for me to connect to 8 right now because I haven't done 7.  Like in my head I have lot of, um, expectation for 7 cause they need to be like, wrapping up like how the sources you know like how we know what the source is-and I know that like if you have a good explanation for like how the sound is produced that like how it moves will be like probably what comes next but I just don't-I don't see it yet."
[01:28:34.09],Michael," Well okay but now I wanna piggyback off of that so as a kid I'm like we are tot-thank you so much Misty, we-we've gotten-Miss Richmond, we've gotten this really great I totally get how sound works.  I am good.  You assessed us we are done."
[01:28:49.19],Gerard, [scoff/chuckles]
[01:28:51.05],Misty, [laughs]
[01:28:51.07],Michael," How are you gonna like, how are you "
[01:28:54.05],Misty, Right
[01:28:54.05],Michael," gonna get em to be like, realize we're not done."
[01:28:57.13],Misty," Oh I think they know we're not done I mean that's only a third of the board right like they-they're like what we still have some other stuff like the-I think they'll be fine like I think they'll see like some con-like we-we need to move on from it like we are done with this and-cause so the funny thing is someone with the tracker um when we were finishing it up for 6 was like I mean they were like we've been on part A for a long time like cause like at this point they're now on the back of that first page cause I only gave em one page to start out with cause I was like what happens if they lose this I don't wanna give em like this whole packet of them and so-but I actually like that they'll only need one page for like bend 1 and I think I'm gonna start a new page for bend 2 um, I think there'll be like a-a row left or something after 7 but I think I'm just gonna give em a new one be like so now we're gonna be looking at like you know how it travels and like sh-here's a new sheet to like record what we've like figured out, um, so they-they're ready to go-you know like to see like what's next after that, I just don't know, like what I should see from this right now.  To have em make that connection for them."
[01:30:09.10],Jamie, I
[01:30:08.17],Michael, Ger-Gerard you wanna add to that oh-go ahead
[01:30:12.02],Gerard," Yeah um, I-I like the ideas that have been brought up in the past of, organizing the driving question board questions based on what three parts of the initial model f-I think it was lesson 1 or 2 what three parts of the initial model um, are these questions dealing with so it's kind of like all right w-we've ac-we've spent a lot of time on the first seven lessons, focusing on how sound is generated from the source we haven't even begun to experience and explore how does it travel, let alone-in the future we're gonna figure out what happens at the receiving end.  So I guess I-what I'm trying to say is revisiting the-the driving questions board and maybe reorganizing the questions what have we-what have we already learned and then what have we not explored yet that we still need to investigate"
[01:31:07.15],Jamie," I um.  I (wan) have-I-I don't know why one of my classes finished like way early today and I don't know what I missed but we finished early and so I had them-I had them do I'm taking everybody on a field trip [picking up and moving computer] uh, [scattered chuckles] there's my driving question board uh, and you can kinda uh (bad at this) I put the three questions up, um, and it was funny cause they like-they started to try and answer the ones from like the sound travel section, and so like they're like I answered it we can-we can make different sounds of different notes and I was like did we really figure that out today or did we figure out what did we figure out and so, that I think is really-I got that from our last meeting like I did it on a sub day I was like everyone pick three questions they think they've answered tell me the evidence and why, then today my kids were like going crazy and I was like what can I do what can I do oh the driving question board go there um, but I think they're-I-I think doing the preassessment actually cause my kids know I told them after I think I-I think we have like another week before we're gonna like really assess the sound making and, this girl looked at me she goes Miss Noll, I'm not ready to tell you about what's happening underwater yet.  Are you gonna ask us that question again from the pre-assessment about under [scattered laughs] I could-I cou-I'm not ready yet, and so, I think that but also like when they, like pushed me today in lesson 6 on the bendy stick, um, they all now wanna try and make it make sound and like, they were like well wait like does that-wait but the sound has to like go through the air but like when we hit it on something so like is there a way to make the stick hit-hit the parts of the air so I think they're like feeling more confident they understand vibrations now and wanna see like what could they do to the air, like make it, make a sound.  So I feel like Gerard have you done lesson 6 yet?  Or lesson 5?"
[01:33:23.27],Gerard, No.  No um
[01:33:24.05],Jamie, I think I fe-
[01:33:28.23],Gerard, I-I was having some technical issues with uh the uh sou-the s-the motion senser-motion detecter.  
[01:33:34.21],Jamie," Yeah.  Um, it-it-I've had to like recalibrate a bunch of-like I feel like after lesson 5 they really start to put some pieces together um."
[01:33:48.19],Michael," So, the theme we hear from you guys and we heard in the other study group is when we're done with the bend and things seem like there's a tidy bow the driving question board is our friend,"
[01:34:00.05],Laura?, Mm-hmm
[01:34:01.03],Misty, Mm-hmm
[01:34:01.00],Michael," And the consensus model's our friend, and the list of investigation's our friend to go back and be like"
[01:34:05.15],Misty, Mm-hmm
[01:34:06.09],Michael," let's take yes we took stock but like what still's left to be done.  And, in-in-I know we haven't had time to look through most of the lessons meant to but I think that-we've heard that a couple times like that is probably the most-the best way to problematize where we're going cause then it-it begs the need for like well we gotta look at some phenomena we're like-what's going on between the two things, would he-would be really tricky right to explain or investigate we gotta dig into that.  Cause like they're not gonna say right that we should look at a truck speaker playing,"
[01:34:38.27],all, [chuckle]
[01:34:40.04],Michael," And make it a window, but they might say like"
[01:34:41.05],Misty, Probably not
[01:34:43.20],Michael," we need-we need something that really helps us think about B more.  Right, what's going on in between like okay, that might have something to do with it, let's take a look at this.  Um"
[01:34:51.21],Gerard, Hey Mike
[01:34:53.28],Michael, Yeah
[01:34:55.17],Gerard," Um, u-going back to uh something um, I think it wa-Wanda you mentioned earlier, um, is about time or was it Laura was it you you're worried about the time, issue and um, you know making sure that we're-getting to the next lesson and I kinda look at this as like it's now like it's three units within a unit um, and I'm thinking of-of like cross-cutting concepts like you know like the water cycle to where NGSS wants us or is-is a shift to going deeper and-and just think of how many different experiences you can uh, do at each stage of the water cycle like from evaporation and then to condensation to, precipitation um, it makes me rethink you know when I um, planned to investigate that with students uh how much deeper you can actually go at each stage, and that's what just kind of reminds me of here where uh, we're u-I'm not even to bend 2 yet but I'm-my students are and I are having so much fun um, digging so deep into it and not worrying so much about the time it takes. [2-second pause]"
[01:36:13.27],Laura, I'll just still be teaching it in January. [scattered chuckles]
[01:36:16.17],Gerard, Of 2019.
[01:36:18.12],Laura, 2019. [scattered chuckles continue]
[01:36:18.09],Michael," (As the)-study session goes on new months are added, [all laugh] like every half hour a study session equals one"
[01:36:27.16],Misty, Yep!  Yep [still laughing]
[01:36:27.26],Michael," one month [indistinct] um, all right we-let me help I wanna focus us a little bit then so the like-I love that you wanna spend the rest of your careers in the (sound)"
[01:36:38.19],Misty?, In the sound unit (laughs)
[01:36:41.24],Michael," Let's-can we-let's can we do maybe one parenthesis-just practicing end bend 2 together, maybe a transition from lesson 8 to 9, or-or-yeah let's do 8 to 9 and just be like what could be like a really, low-hanging fruit question to ask a really co-uh well-framed prompt that would help kids sort of say oh we should totally like, do something like what we're gonna need to do in lesson 9 anyways, help them articulate the question that lesson 9 is trying to get us to, or the question-or the idea for investigation, lesson 9's trying to get us to, and-like Jamie said 8 is like what's up with the medium, right that's gonna where we're at, but 9, well let's-let's take a peek at 9.  And um, okay so"
[01:37:31.12],Laura, They're already asking me this.
[01:37:33.01],Michael, What's the this they were asking?
[01:37:36.16],Laura," They're already asking me about what's happening-I mean they're already so intrigued by what's going on they keep saying well what's happening in the air, what's happening in the air, so,"
[01:37:45.11],Jamie, I'm in the dark [moves so light turns on]
[01:37:47.05],Laura, Yeah we haven't done lesson 4 yet [laughs]
[01:37:49.14],Jamie, My kids go on every day it's like
[01:37:50.20],Michael, So-[indistinct]
[01:37:52.02],Jamie," can we take the air away, like in space, [2-second pause]"
[01:37:55.26],Misty, Mm
[01:37:55.28],Jamie," Like, like they wanna-they were like, what about if an astronaut (played) an instrument"
[01:38:03.28],Michael," All right so you guys already have it on your radar, but let's say-I mean you're in my class like my kids don't have it and I'm like how do they get from 8 to 9 can you-can everyone take a minute just kind of look at that and like, right if it's not on our radar and we're not like bringing it up every day how might it come up, or how can we help, prime the kids to suggest the idea for, then (in question for add an idea to the investigation).  Let's take a minute to look between the-"
[01:38:29.21],Gerard's principal, How are you on here you're talking to somebody
[01:38:32.05],Gerard, Psst [gesturing] [whispers something] (I'm in a study group)
[01:38:39.21],Gerard's principal, Okay
[01:38:40.23],Misty, [chuckles]
[01:38:42.00],Gerard, [whispers something] [Michael and Gerard's principal wave]
[01:38:42.19],Gerard, My principal.  Amazing principal
[01:38:45.19],Gerard's principal, Aw thanks [chuckle]
[01:38:47.07],Gerard, These guys (are the best) [indistinct whispering between Gerard and principal] [others wave]
[01:38:58.00],Michael," Gerard's an amazing teacher,"
[01:39:00.04],Gerard's principal," Oh I am well aware, I love him.  Golden apple winner."
[01:39:05.05],Gerard," I'm so excited to be part of this though, you guys are all teaching me things evey minute (glad) I'm a part of it um, I'm still looking at the-the-the board we made though the color-coded ones, cause I remember um, I think Laura we were working on our lesson together"
[01:39:24.10],Laura, Yep
[01:39:25.16],Gerard," and breaking it apart,"
[01:39:29.20],Gerard's principal, [indistinct] (I'm out)
[01:39:30.12],Gerard, Thank you
[01:39:31.11],Man 1 in Gerard's room?, (Are you staying or I)
[01:39:31.20],Gerard, Is Mary still here?  Is Hollis still here?
[01:39:33.12],Gerard's Principal, nuh-uh (lock up)
[01:39:34.18],Man 1, No.  (You know how to lock up)
[01:39:35.19],Gerard," Yeah I got the code, got code thank you!  Thanks guys!  Sorry I should have muted I apologize. [Michael makes a shrugging gesture, 7-second pause]"
[01:39:51.29],Michael," Maybe give about thirty more seconds and then see if anyone can give us a, a transition for my class imagining we have not even thought about the idea of messing with the area. [15-second pause]"
[01:40:17.22],Gerard," We have on the board, like transition arrows the one that we created where the question is asked you know after a-you know how did the sound get to the window I like the question I don't know, how we added it but it was just a simple question how is this possible"
[01:40:38.20],Laura, Hmm.
[01:40:40.04],Gerard," It's a really simple question that really, can go in so many different directions in terms of thinking about it,"
[01:40:47.09],Michael," Gerard, how is what possible say more about it"
[01:40:50.02],Gerard," Well, it-uh-it says lesson 8 how does the sound get from the source to the window, and then where the phenomenon that's being investigated is the loud music the car shaking you know the window's also shaking but then it says sound from one place can affect something else and just getting them to think how is this possible makes em wonder ask-forces them to wonder about what's going on in between. [2-second pause]"
[01:41:22.02],Michael, So you-you (course) sort of saying focusing on the causal like really pushing like what the heck is going on how can this make this thing happen it really forces us to say like what's-what's going on in here
[01:41:34.12],Gerard, Right
[01:41:35.19],Michael, And that will help foreground the idea that-this is something to do-we gotta-we gotta do something with air.
[01:41:40.13],Gerard, Right. [4-second pause]
[01:41:44.28],Michael, What do others think? [2-second pause]
[01:41:48.05],Misty," Um I feel like my students haven't pressed or-at least vocalized much about air except for one student when we first set up for lesson 5 and they were um, we were graphing the resting position and so, like class is over and like they're leaving and he's like hanging out and I was like what's like do you need something he's like so you know how everybody said it was a straight line right and I was like yes did you not think it was a straight line he's like I mean it was kinda straight do you think it wasn't straight cause like because there are air particles that are like pushing on it also and I was like, I don't know what do you think but it was like one of those things always where I was like wow that was really interesting like I wasn't expecting him to like say that and so I don't know that they necessarily um, s-other people might be thinking these things too that they just haven't like vocalized at all and it might be-cause even the way that he came over there I was like he didn't say that in front of other people because it was like oh everybody must have assumed that it's straight like there's nothing else here and so I think, they might be thinking it and so hopefully it'll be something that kinda comes up, as they're-they're seeing it travel from one place to the next and that's like there's nothing else """"there"""" other than air so I feel like they would, come to this you know like it must be somehow traveling through the air it's not like there's water or like some other medium that it's traveling through."
[01:43:25.27],Michael, Misty I hear you saying like too though like if it doesn't connect to the previous lesson it could connect back to lesson 6 or something you mean like
[01:43:33.22],Misty, mm-hmm
[01:43:33.22],Michael," so this stick it's moving, how the heck could that get something else to move and with something larger somebody"
[01:43:38.26],Misty, Right.
[01:43:39.29],Michael," might be like well isn't it just pushing the air around or something maybe like oh maybe that is how it works and like, how can we ever investigate like cause I heard you say a couple times, if in earlier lessons it's a productive space to-to-to link to"
[01:43:53.26],Misty, Mm-hmm
[01:43:54.09],Michael, that's another way to establish coherence right go back to previous phenomenon and be like how could that be
[01:43:58.19],Misty," Right, right"
[01:43:59.18],Michael, Our time is unfortunately
[01:44:01.27],Jamie, Like when I [indistinct]
[01:44:04.13],Michael, Go ahead Jamie you wanna (say a planting the seed)
[01:44:04.28],Jamie," Or like it's like what I said earlier about like planting that seed like just you can mention it and like have like something that you guys did (ins) too and like write that down on the side of your paper, or add it to the driving question board.  [indistinct]"
[01:44:20.22],Michael," I've got-two seeds-two seeds we want you to think about planting, going forward, one are these uh kind of-you know prompts from the strategic inquiry tool that you're like ooh I want to focus on goal 2 wanna focus on goal 5, I wanna plant a few more seeds, and I wanna try and (end) the lesson maybe it's lesson 9 or 10 or 11 we'd like you to pick one of those.  And at the same time I think about what other seeds that are content lesson specific that you might want to plant that help really frame the prompts that will get kids to say maybe we should go here next or we should do this investigation next or this is our next question.  And we'd like you to reflect on it between now and our-our next time if also might-and keep track of what you do, so-pick one and also we-we suggest like this could be a great one for you also to administer to your-to your student survey for cause you can be like ooh I wanna see what they think about that, was that coherent for them and we'll then get you the results once you can analyze it and be like oh that's cool that worked and this one wait now they're saying maybe there's a trade-off in this or this really didn't or this did work and get a little bit of a-a sense from your students what they're thinking in terms of the coherence-from their perspective.  Yeah.  So one lesson, try these prompts-from the strategic inquiry tool, keep a record, try to administer the survey that day too and then we'll get you those uh results back to you for our next meeting here we'll-we'll work as part of our theme"
[01:45:49.19],Renee?, Gerard [laughing] [Gerard holds lizard up to his camera]
[01:45:52.23],Gerard, [laughs]
[01:45:55.08],all, [scattered chuckles]
[01:45:55.09],Renee, that's big
[01:45:56.10],Michael, is that Gerard-Gerard is do-it's 7:01 Gerard is done
[01:46:00.26],Renee, Yup
[01:46:01.29],Gerard, 6:01
[01:46:04.27],Michael, Any other questions or comments for the group for the good of the order
[01:46:08.09],Laura, I just wanna give Wanda props on her twitter feed I'm loving watching what she's putting out there every day I'm like oh that's a really good idea so Wanda way to go [laughs]
[01:46:21.05],Renee, Yay
[01:46:21.06],Gerard, I wanna ask what is-what is the uh Twitter hit-uh what do you call it Twitter handle
[01:46:27.13],Laura, Hashtag?
[01:46:29.14],Gerard, Yeah yeah that
[01:46:29.29],Laura, So I've been using NGSS NGSX or NGSX project and those seem to connect us together.
[01:46:37.06],Gerard, Okay.  Thanks
[01:46:41.03],Renee, Awesome.  Thanks everybody
[01:46:44.21],Michael," In case anyone wants to stick around okay everyone else take care, stick around if you have any last-minute questions or technical things you wanna debug, otherwise we'll see you"
[01:46:54.05],Laura, Are there anybody watching from behind like Kelsey or anybody
[01:46:57.01],Renee," Uh Trey,"
[01:46:59.01],Laura," Okay.  Just as a question about like our, um, uh, the mailing labels like I haven't gotten mailing labels yet so I haven't sent you guys anything,"
[01:47:10.03],Renee, Trey are you there
[01:47:11.03],Laura, Trey are you there
[01:47:13.04],Gerard, Hmm
[01:47:14.28],Renee, I think he is but
[01:47:16.00],Michael, I think he is too
[01:47:18.10],Renee, Okay muted
[01:47:20.00],Gerard, Hey Mike I still have my
[01:47:21.03],Renee, (there's barely enough) I've
[01:47:22.22],Gerard," Mike I sent you a chat uh message um, in regards to the technical issue I'm having so.  Check it out"
[01:47:30.19],Michael," I wanna help you debu-debug it, do we wanna try it (so at) early in the morning,"
[01:47:35.01],Gerard, Yeah I'm a-I'm actually free uh in the morning what time
[01:47:39.09],Michael," Earlier is better cause I'm an hour behind, you"
[01:47:42.09],Gerard," Okay, um"
[01:47:44.20],Renee, Hour ahead of him you're an hour ahead of him
[01:47:44.23],Michael," we do--ahead of m--can you do before, 7 [chuckles]"
[01:47:50.26],Gerard," Um, before 7 o'clock uh yeah, yeah I can make it work,"
[01:47:56.23],Michael, Can we try 6:30 your time
[01:47:59.26],Gerard, Yeah totally
[01:48:00.07],Renee, Michael's in Con-Michael's in Connecticut right now leading uh NGSX part 2 with some Connecticut teachers
[01:48:06.03],Gerard, Oh you know what
[01:48:06.06],Misty?, Ahhh
[01:48:07.26],Gerard," um, I actually have to get my son uh he normally rides a-a van to school but I have to get him to school tomorrow morning um, so um, I'll touch base with you via email we can figure something out."
[01:48:23.15],Micahel, Okay or-text me but you have my phone number right?
[01:48:26.21],Gerard," Uh, let me punch it in right now just to make sure [2.5-second pause] Okay"
[01:48:34.04],Renee, Laura I'll ask Trey about the mailing labels for you
[01:48:37.17],Laura," Okay I just-I know you guys want the, surveys the permission forms and whatever, um student activity sheets, is that correct, [2-second pause]"
[01:48:51.25],Michael, Yes please
[01:48:52.21],Renee, Yeah.
[01:48:53.15],Laura, Okay my first couple units they got glued into their science notebooks cause I wasn't thinking you guys needed them but
[01:48:59.14],Renee, Well
[01:49:00.20],Laura, I'll send them out
[01:49:00.09],Renee," Michael we should clarify do you want the student activity sheets or, or"
[01:49:04.10],Michael, from so-uh
[01:49:04.15],Renee, are you asking
[01:49:05.16],Michael," they're fro-yes we do from cer-certain lessons I think we've put together um a list of which ones those were so, is that-we don't need all of them,"
[01:49:13.19],Laura, Okay
[01:49:14.23],Michael, And maybe I should-we should pull up which ones those are here
[01:49:17.10],Laura," Yeah I mean is there someplace that that's I know that's probably the data collection form somewhere,"
[01:49:22.13],Misty, Yeah I have-I've seen that
[01:49:23.23],Laura, A lot of forms
[01:49:25.03],Misty, [laughs]
[01:49:25.29],all, [scattered chuckles]
[01:49:27.17],Misty, (very confusing)
[01:49:27.26],Gerard," Hey Misty,"
[01:49:29.23],Misty, Yes
[01:49:31.14],Gerard, At-since CPS hasn't approved this yet have you just been sending them in without the students' names?
[01:49:36.16],Misty," The only thing I've shared, thus far have been like posterized things so like things that I wrote from them or, like those posters they work on together they don't have any names on them I haven't done any like individual student work, um"
[01:49:52.06],Gerard, Mike or Renee do you want us to send
[01:49:53.09],Misty," But I was gonna ask about that process if things were going or, [makes face]"
[01:49:58.19],Renee, I think
[01:49:58.26],Gerard, Would you guys like us to
[01:50:00.18],Renee, I think (this has for you) for Chicago teachers to just hold onto it until you get approval
[01:50:06.07],Gerard, Okay.  Okay
[01:50:06.13],Misty, Yeah cause we-cause we were not supposed to pass out any of those forms to parents or anything right [3-second pause]
[01:50:15.01],Trey, R-right don't hand out the consent form
[01:50:15.29],Misty, cause-cause I have not yeah yeah okay I was just
[01:50:19.04],Renee, Oh there's Trey yay Trey
[01:50:20.21],Misty, [chuckles]
[01:50:22.22],Michael, Trey I was quickly looking for a link of which artifacts we were hoping to collect from which lessons but I'm-I'm-I'm trying to find it (how are)
[01:50:30.07],Trey," Oh yeah so it's, i-it's actually so the email that I send out every time there's a uh, one of these"
[01:50:35.05],Misty, Yeah that's what I was gonna say
[01:50:36.29],Trey," meetings that, it's at the bottom"
[01:50:37.15],Laura, That's what I was looking at
[01:50:38.17],Trey," it's at the bottom there's a Google Doc that says data collection, I think it says data, "
[01:50:45.12],Misty, Hmm
[01:50:45.24],Trey, You're asking me for it and now I'm I'm like struggling to
[01:50:48.26],Renee, Trey
[01:50:49.19],Misty, it says (here's the sheet)
[01:50:49.23],Renee, are you talking about the Google doc oh yeah
[01:50:52.14],Trey, just one big Google Doc
[01:50:53.00],Renee," LWT MS Sound yeah, go ahead"
[01:50:55.00],Trey," Right, and if you s-if you scroll all the way to the bottom, the table should be there"
[01:51:01.00],Misty, Yep
[01:51:01.11],Renee, Yeah it's there
[01:51:02.05],Misty," Yeah so it sa-it's three from lesson 1 two from lesson 4 lesson 7, 16"
[01:51:09.03],Renee, And those are largely consensus models right like say you 
[01:51:12.08],Misty, Yeah
[01:51:12.25],Renee," could take photographs of those you could, so it's not um-Laura it's not all of the, student sheets"
[01:51:17.11],Laura, Okay so-I've just been taking photos of all of our consensus models so I'll just do that
[01:51:22.03],Misty, Mm-hmm
[01:51:23.03],Laura, Okay.  Okay
[01:51:27.14],Michael, Cool.
[01:51:28.04],Misty, The assessments though like you would like that it looks like
[01:51:30.14],Laura, Right I have all the assessments and I have all the permission forms
[01:51:33.26],Misty, Okay
[01:51:35.11],Renee, Trey I don't know if you heard Laura say
[01:51:35.11],Misty, well what's the
[01:51:37.17],Renee, that she doesn't have mailing labels yet (didn't know) if you could give an update on that
[01:51:40.29],Trey," Oh I mean Kelsey's sent them out I'm-I-they should arrive soon, if you don't get them, um by Monday can you just shoot me an email please"
[01:51:50.18],Laura, Sure
[01:51:51.02],Trey," I'm sorry tha-to add an extra thing to your plate I know you're busy, but um"
[01:51:53.16],Laura, (nah) [chuckles]
[01:51:53.28],Trey, hopefully by Monday [chuckles]
[01:51:57.16],Laura," Yeah.  Um, I-hopefully yeah.  Okay.  That was my last question, hope you all have a lovely two weeks"
[01:52:05.03],Renee, All right you too [chorus of you too/goodnights]
[01:52:06.29],Laura, (Renee will I be seeing you this weekend)
[01:52:10.10],Renee, Yes I'll email you I think-yeah I'll
[01:52:12.28],Laura, Jean's coming Monday and Tuesday
[01:52:15.07],Renee, Yeah and then I'm meeting with Colleen the following week so I thought maybe I'd come see you then.  If you're up for it
[01:52:19.22],Laura," Colleen's coming to, play with me tomorrow"
[01:52:21.19],Renee," Yay, that's great"
[01:52:22.17],Laura," Yeah, okay"
[01:52:24.23],Renee," All right, I'll email you"
[01:52:26.05],Laura, all right see you later
[01:52:26.19],Renee, bye
[01:52:27.13],Laura, Bye
[01:52:29.07],Renee, All right guys
[01:52:32.20],Michael, Gerard you'll-contact me?
[01:52:33.23],Gerard," Yeah um, I just sent you an email asking if you can just send me your number when you get a chance and I'll, get a hold of you tomorrow,"
[01:52:40.15],Michael, (sounds good) cool [indistinct]
[01:52:40.15],Gerard, Thanks so much.  Bye guys
[01:52:43.27],Michael, (Yes sir) bye
[01:52:43.14],Renee, Bye Gerard
[01:52:44.14],Gerard, Thank you
[01:52:46.25],Renee," All right Michael go have dinner, cause you have to teach tomorrow"
[01:52:50.11],Michael, No we should debrief real quick
[01:52:53.09],Renee, Okay
[01:52:53.20],Michael, So what'd you think
[01:52:56.14],Renee," Uh, it's al-it's always fascinating to me-you know to-every-group is different right in terms of, the stuff that they wanna talk about and, we did-you know it didn't, we didn't have as much time, for certain things cause but they wanted to talk about others, I'm starting to not love talking sticks, cause I feel like they can't like talk to each other, u-you know I tried to structure it a little bit more where-so then we could come back to Wanda's question um, I th--"
[01:53:22.06],Michael," It was nice I thought, that was nice to make sure that we were like still, orbiting around her"
[01:53:28.12],Renee, Yeah
[01:53:28.14],Michael, Issue that she had brought
[01:53:30.01],Renee," I mean I think that the-the stuff that they're saying is helping with those questions but, y-one might not feel that unless it's sort of like directly addressed so, um, I don't know.  I think that, I'm interested to talk to (Tara), and I think (they've) worked on this together the way that they phrased it in MBER this last session where they, the way they did their poll was like these sort of 4 choices like what-which thing should we talk about, and then they talked about those things and the troubleshooting and they didn't do a full share-out with, of noticings, um, I'm not saying it's bad-the way we're doing it is bad I'm just wondering I'm just wondering sometimes it feels like it goes better than others"
[01:54:10.06],Michael," It does-it-well and I feel like both weeks we focus more on troubleshooting, correctly"
[01:54:15.21],Renee," Yeah, yup"
[01:54:16.10],Michael," but you know we like, learn to the half-hour on it which is I feel like"
[01:54:19.01],Renee, right
[01:54:19.18],Michael," more genuine for the group to be like let's dig into the thing we wanna dig into, um,"
[01:54:23.04],Renee," Right and they had posted the noticing anyway and if that's-the noticing might be priming the pump for everything else we're doing, so--you know what I mean"
[01:54:31.05],Michael," Right.  So yeah I gotta think like, we're not gonna see em for two weeks so, what will our theme be,"
[01:54:38.23],Renee, Well we definitely want
[01:54:41.01],Michael, [indistinct]
[01:54:41.09],Renee," that-you know we're asking them to reflect on, some sort of discussion and, how they helped what they did with their kids and sort of what happened as a result of it, we'll wanna come up with some specific things where they could be, reflecting on that I'm not exactly sure what that-that should look like but, I think we wanna spend some time there"
[01:54:56.28],Michael, (mm)
[01:54:57.12],Renee," And then, um, I don't know you're always very good at saying and this is coming up we should talk about this, like maybe it's the next assessment or maybe, I don't know, is there a question of the five questions that we haven't spent, much time on? [5-second pause]"
[01:55:16.25],Michael," uh, no"
[01:55:18.10],Renee," Well question 4, a little bit, how do we push students to go deeper, and revise the science ideas we've build together so far. [2-second pause]"
[01:55:29.10],Michael, I could see towards the end of bend 2 that being a thing
[01:55:34.20],Renee, [nodding] which some of-well no
[01:55:35.29],Michael," Like-like, like what ideas are, are you really-what-in what ways are you trying to support, what ways have you found successful helping support students to really make a-a deeper, deeper sense-making around the particulate interactions and outcomes, like-we could maybe make a very particle-focused,"
[01:55:56.04],Renee, Yeah or maybe even
[01:55:56.19],Michael, If-if everyone's there
[01:55:57.23],Renee," Yeah they might not be to that point yet or-maybe I-oh could we, put, could we even come up with a few things that students have said, that aren't very deep and sort of throw that like, okay so a student says this, what do you do"
[01:56:10.23],Michael, Right [indistinct]
[01:56:11.26],Renee," or a student says-and we could pull it, I mean we can make stuff up that we know kids have said that we've heard kids say as we're in these classrooms but we can also pull from any student artifacts, we could pu-right, as a way to-then"
[01:56:22.28],Michael," right so, so-so like if they say that, a-course air doesn't or-sound doesn't travel through space, we all know that"
[01:56:29.11],Renee," Right, yeah"
[01:56:30.24],Michael, right like-why doesn't it? Right cause
[01:56:34.05],Renee, Yeah (that's) [indistinct]
[01:56:34.18],Michael," I feel like-I don't understand why not, I mean I've heard of it but I don't get why,"
[01:56:38.27],Renee, Right.  Yeah so how can we get then kids to dig deeper and what does that look-I don't know so-so (I'll) be thinking about that
[01:56:44.18],Michael," Okay, cool [2-second pause]"
[01:56:48.15],Renee, Okay
[01:56:49.27],Michael, I think
[01:56:51.16],Renee, (are you having fun)
[01:56:51.28],Michael," the group's got a great, great great trust and vibe with each other"
[01:56:55.05],Renee, Me too
[01:56:55.27],Michael, Feel like they're really [makes gesture] getting tighter.
[01:57:01.02],Renee," I wa-I-I just think that it is a nice support for each other and I think in general I feel like the time is well-spent for them in this hour and a half but I just wanna make sure that it is you know what I mean like, I-I always worry in the beginning part like, [makes gesture] especially the talking stick part like is this-is this helpful sometimes it-I feel like it really is productive and then other times I'm like eh, we gotta-would you agree Trey?"
[01:57:26.14],Trey, I oh yeah.  I agree.  I mean I think-I think you wanted to structure it cause you don't want it to be a free-for-all but now it's just kind of
[01:57:32.05],Renee, Right
[01:57:32.15],Trey," it's a little too, just like all right now we'll talk now you talk and there's not enough cross-talk."
[01:57:39.21],Renee," Yeah.  Are-are-or-and there are parts where that does happen but then there are-that-the talking stick part is not one where that happens, right?"
[01:57:48.22],Trey, [nods] that's my sense [2-second pause]
[01:57:51.11],Michael, Yeah [indistinct]
[01:57:52.13],Renee, Okay
[01:57:53.09],Michael," was really built for making sure (that) we had equitable, discussion format"
[01:57:57.11],Renee," Well and that is an issue particularly with this particular study group too, there are a couple people who could talk and go on and on and on and on and I love to hear them talk but it's taking-it's hard for the-you know what I mean like it's talking some of the time so I-I actually had to like step in and interrupt someone,"
[01:58:13.01],Michael," [indistinct, nodding]"
[01:58:13.18],Renee," so there is some aspect of like hey we're gonna put a little time on this while we're sharing out, that is maybe needed, so that we don't have to interrupt people but, anyway so we have to-, weigh that. [2-second pause] All right think about it over dinner"
[01:58:33.08],Michael, Ciao.  Bye.  Oh sorry Trey
[01:58:34.09],Trey," I wa-sorry real quick, did you guys decide on your meeting for the debrief for next week or do I need to send out another poll, like did you guys decide at the last meeting at the end [Michael makes ""you"" gusture]"
[01:58:43.21],Renee," You have to send out another poll [Renee mimics ""you"" gesture]"
[01:58:45.07],Michael, Trey that's you you gotta send out another poll
[01:58:44.21],Trey," [indistinct] All right great, great uh you'll get one soon like bye"
